**Trixi.jl** is a numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation
laws written in [Julia](https://julialang.org). A key objective for the
framework is to be useful to both scientists and students. Therefore, next to
having an extensible design with a fast implementation, Trixi.jl is
focused on being easy to use for new or inexperienced users, including the
installation and postprocessing procedures. Its features include:

* 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations on [line/quad/hex/simplex meshes](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/overview/#Semidiscretizations)
  * Cartesian and curvilinear meshes
  * Conforming and non-conforming meshes
  * Structured and unstructured meshes
  * Hierarchical quadtree/octree grid with adaptive mesh refinement
  * Forests of quadtrees/octrees with [p4est](https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est) via [P4est.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/P4est.jl)
* High-order accuracy in space and time
* Discontinuous Galerkin methods
  * Kinetic energy-preserving and entropy-stable methods based on flux differencing
  * Entropy-stable shock capturing
  * Positivity-preserving limiting
  * [Finite difference summation by parts (SBP) methods](https://github.com/ranocha/SummationByPartsOperators.jl)
* Compatible with the [SciML ecosystem for ordinary differential equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/)
  * [Explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta time integration](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Low-Storage-Methods)
  * [Strong stability preserving methods](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Strong-Stability-Preserving-Runge-Kutta-Methods-for-Hyperbolic-PDEs-(Conservation-Laws))
  * CFL-based and error-based time step control
* Native support for differentiable programming
  * Forward mode automatic differentiation via [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl)
* Periodic and weakly-enforced boundary conditions
* Multiple governing equations:
  * Compressible Euler equations
  * Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations
  * Multi-component compressible Euler and MHD equations
  * Linearized Euler and acoustic perturbation equations
  * Hyperbolic diffusion equations for elliptic problems
  * Lattice-Boltzmann equations (D2Q9 and D3Q27 schemes)
  * Shallow water equations
  * Several scalar conservation laws (e.g., linear advection, Burgers' equation)
* Multi-physics simulations
  * [Self-gravitating gas dynamics](https://github.com/trixi-framework/paper-self-gravitating-gas-dynamics)
* Shared-memory parallelization via multithreading
* Visualization and postprocessing of the results
  * In-situ and a posteriori visualization with [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
  * Interactive visualization with [Makie.jl](https://makie.juliaplots.org/)
  * Postprocessing with ParaView/VisIt via [Trixi2Vtk](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl)


## Installation
If you have not yet installed Julia, please [follow the instructions for your
operating system](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). Trixi.jl works
with Julia v1.8 and newer. We recommend using the latest stable release of Julia.

### For users
Trixi.jl and its related tools are registered Julia packages. Hence, you
can install Trixi.jl, the visualization tool
[Trixi2Vtk](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl),
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl), and
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
by executing the following commands in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(["Trixi", "Trixi2Vtk", "OrdinaryDiffEq", "Plots"])
```
You can copy and paste all commands to the REPL *including* the leading
`julia>` prompts - they will automatically be stripped away by Julia.
The package [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
provides time integration schemes used by Trixi.jl, while
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) can be used to directly
visualize Trixi.jl's results from the REPL.

*Note on package versions:* If some of the examples for how to use Trixi.jl do not
work, verify that you are using a recent Trixi.jl release by comparing the
installed Trixi.jl version from
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.update("Trixi"); Pkg.status("Trixi")
```
to the [latest release](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/releases/latest).
If the installed version does not match the current release, please check the
*Troubleshooting* section in the [documentation](#documentation).

The commands above can also be used to update Trixi.jl. A brief list of notable
changes to Trixi.jl is available in [`NEWS.md`](NEWS.md).

### For developers
If you plan on editing Trixi.jl itself, you can download Trixi.jl locally and use the
code from the cloned directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:trixi-framework/Trixi.jl.git
cd Trixi.jl
mkdir run
cd run
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=".."))' # Install local Trixi.jl clone
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(["OrdinaryDiffEq", "Trixi2Vtk", "Plots"])' # Install additional packages
```
Note that the postprocessing tools Trixi2Vtk.jl and Plots.jl are optional and
can be omitted.

If you installed Trixi.jl this way, you always have to start Julia with the `--project`
flag set to your `run` directory, e.g.,
```bash
julia --project=.
```
if already inside the `run` directory.
Further details can be found in the [documentation](#documentation).


## Usage
In the Julia REPL, first load the package Trixi.jl
```julia
julia> using Trixi
```
Then start a simulation by executing
```julia
julia> trixi_include(default_example())
```
Please be patient since Julia will compile the code just before running it.
To visualize the results, load the package Plots
```julia
julia> using Plots
```
and generate a heatmap plot of the results with
```julia
julia> plot(sol) # No trailing semicolon, otherwise no plot is shown
```
This will open a new window with a 2D visualization of the final solution:

</p>

The method `trixi_include(...)` expects a single string argument with the path to a
Trixi.jl elixir, i.e., a text file containing Julia code necessary to set up and run a
simulation. To quickly see Trixi.jl in action, `default_example()`
returns the path to an example elixir with a short, two-dimensional
problem setup. A list of all example elixirs packaged with Trixi.jl can be
obtained by running `get_examples()`. Alternatively, you can also browse the
[`examples/`](examples/) subdirectory.
If you want to modify one of the elixirs to set up your own simulation,
download it to your machine, edit the configuration, and pass the file path to
`trixi_include(...)`.

*Note on performance:* Julia uses just-in-time compilation to transform its
source code to native, optimized machine code at the *time of execution* and
caches the compiled methods for further use. That means that the first execution
of a Julia method is typically slow, with subsequent runs being much faster. For
instance, in the example above the first execution of `trixi_include` takes about
20 seconds, while subsequent runs require less than 60 *milli*seconds.

### Showcase of advanced features
The presentation [From Mesh Generation to Adaptive Simulation: A Journey in Julia](https://youtu.be/_N4ozHr-t9E),
originally given as part of JuliaCon 2022, outlines how to use Trixi.jl for an adaptive simulation
of the compressible Euler equations in two spatial dimensions on a complex domain. More details
as well as code to run the simulation presented can be found at the
[reproducibility repository](https://github.com/trixi-framework/talk-2022-juliacon_toolchain)
for the presentation.

## Documentation
Additional documentation is available that contains more information on how to
modify/extend Trixi.jl's implementation, how to visualize output files etc. It
also includes a section on our preferred development workflow and some tips for
using Git. The latest documentation can be accessed either
[online](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable) or under [`docs/src`](docs/src).
