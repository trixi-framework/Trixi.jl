    ShallowWaterEquations2D(; gravity, H0 = 0, threshold_limiter = nothing, threshold_wet = nothing)

Shallow water equations (SWE) in two space dimensions. The equations are given by
```math
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(h v_1)
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(h v_2) &= 0 \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(h v_1) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(h v_1^2 + \frac{g}{2}h^2\right)
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(h v_1 v_2) + g h \frac{\partial b}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(h v_2) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(h v_1 v_2)
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(h v_2^2 + \frac{g}{2}h^2\right) + g h \frac{\partial b}{\partial y} &= 0.
\end{aligned}
```
The unknown quantities of the SWE are the water height ``h`` and the velocities ``\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2)^T``.
The gravitational constant is denoted by `g` and the (possibly) variable bottom topography function ``b(x,y)``.
Conservative variable water height ``h`` is measured from the bottom topography ``b``, therefore one
also defines the total water height as ``H = h + b``.

The additional quantity ``H_0`` is also available to store a reference value for the total water height that
is useful to set initial conditions or test the "lake-at-rest" well-balancedness.

Also, there are two thresholds which prevent numerical problems as well as instabilities. Both of them do not
have to be passed, as default values are defined within the struct. The first one, `threshold_limiter`, is
used in [`PositivityPreservingLimiterShallowWater`](@ref) on the water height, as a (small) shift on the initial
condition and cutoff before the next time step. The second one, `threshold_wet`, is applied on the water height to
define when the flow is "wet" before calculating the numerical flux.

The bottom topography function ``b(x,y)`` is set inside the initial condition routine
for a particular problem setup. To test the conservative form of the SWE one can set the bottom topography
variable `b` to zero.

In addition to the unknowns, Trixi.jl currently stores the bottom topography values at the approximation points
despite being fixed in time. This is done for convenience of computing the bottom topography gradients
on the fly during the approximation as well as computing auxiliary quantities like the total water height ``H``
or the entropy variables.
This affects the implementation and use of these equations in various ways:
* The flux values corresponding to the bottom topography must be zero.
* The bottom topography values must be included when defining initial conditions, boundary conditions or
  source terms.
* [`AnalysisCallback`](@ref) analyzes this variable.
* Trixi.jl's visualization tools will visualize the bottom topography by default.

References for the SWE are many but a good introduction is available in Chapter 13 of the book:

A particular type of hydrostatic reconstruction of the water height to guarantee well-balancedness
for a general bottom topography of the [`ShallowWaterEquations2D`](@ref). The reconstructed solution states
`u_ll_star` and `u_rr_star` variables are then used to evaluate the surface numerical flux at the interface.
The key idea is a linear reconstruction of the bottom and water height at the interfaces using subcells.
Use in combination with the generic numerical flux routine [`FluxHydrostaticReconstruction`](@ref).

Special estimate of the minimal and maximal wave speed of the shallow water equations for
the left and right states `u_ll, u_rr`. These approximate speeds are used for the HLL-type
numerical flux [`flux_hll_chen_noelle`](@ref). These wave speed estimates
together with a particular hydrostatic reconstruction technique guarantee
that the numerical flux is positive and satisfies an entropy inequality.

Further details on this hydrostatic reconstruction and its motivation can be found in
the reference below. The definition of the wave speeds are given in Equation (2.20).
