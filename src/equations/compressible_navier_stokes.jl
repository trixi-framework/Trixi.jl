    struct BoundaryConditionNavierStokesWall

Creates a wall-type boundary conditions for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, see
[`CompressibleNavierStokesDiffusion1D`](@ref), [`CompressibleNavierStokesDiffusion2D`](@ref), and
[`CompressibleNavierStokesDiffusion3D`](@ref).
The fields `boundary_condition_velocity` and `boundary_condition_heat_flux` are intended
to be boundary condition types such as the [`NoSlip`](@ref) velocity boundary condition and the
[`Adiabatic`](@ref) or [`Isothermal`](@ref) heat boundary condition.

    struct NoSlip

Use to create a no-slip boundary condition with [`BoundaryConditionNavierStokesWall`](@ref). 
The field `boundary_value_function` should be a function with signature 
`boundary_value_function(x, t, equations)` and return a `SVector{NDIMS}` 
whose entries are the velocity vector at a point `x` and time `t`.

"""
    struct Slip

Creates a symmetric velocity boundary condition which eliminates any normal velocity gradients across the boundary, i.e., 
allows only the tangential velocity gradients to be non-zero.
When combined with the heat boundary condition [`Adiabatic`](@ref), this creates a truly symmetric boundary condition.
Any boundary on which this combined boundary condition is applied thus acts as a symmetry plane for the flow.
In contrast to the [`NoSlip`](@ref) boundary condition, `Slip` does not require a function to be supplied.

The (purely) hyperbolic equivalent boundary condition is [`boundary_condition_slip_wall`](@ref) which 
permits only tangential velocities.

This boundary condition can also be employed as a reflective wall.

Note that in 1D this degenerates to the [`NoSlip`](@ref) boundary condition which must be used instead.

!!! note
    Currently this (velocity) boundary condition is only implemented for 
    [`P4estMesh`](@ref) and [`GradientVariablesPrimitive`](@ref).

temperature at point `x` and time `t`.
