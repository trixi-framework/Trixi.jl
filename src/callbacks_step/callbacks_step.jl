# `include` callback definitions in the order that we currently prefer
# when combining them into a `CallbackSet` which is called *after* a complete step
# The motivation is as follows:
# * `SummaryCallback` controls, among other things, timers and should thus be first
# * `SteadyStateCallback` may mark a time step as the last step, which is needed by other callbacks
# * `AnalysisCallback` may also do some checks that mark a step as the last one
# * `AliveCallback` belongs to `AnalysisCallback` and should thus be nearby
# * `SaveRestartCallback`/`SaveSolutionCallback` should save the current solution state before it is
#   potentially degraded by AMR
# * `AMRCallback` really belongs to the next time step already, as it should be the "first" callback
#   in a time step loop (however, callbacks are always executed *after* a step, thus it comes near
#   the end here)
# * `StepsizeCallback` must come after AMR to accomodate potential changes in the minimum cell size
# * `GlmSpeedCallback` must come after computing time step size because it affects the value of c_h
# * `LBMCollisionCallback` must come after computing time step size because it is already part of
#    the next time step calculation
