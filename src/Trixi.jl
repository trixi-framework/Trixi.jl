module Trixi

# Set ndim as a short, module-wide constant.
# Rationale: This makes code easier to understand than using hardcoded dimension values.
"""
Specify the number of spatial dimensions.

Always use `ndim` instead of hard-coding the literal `2` when referring to the
number of dimensions. This makes code easier to understand, since it adds a
meaning to the number.
