"""
    UnstructuredSortedBoundaryTypes

General container to sort the boundary conditions by type for some unstructured meshes/solvers.
It stores a set of global indices for each boundary condition type to expedite computation
during the call to `calc_boundary_flux!`. The original dictionary form of the boundary conditions
set by the user in the elixir file is also stored for printing.
