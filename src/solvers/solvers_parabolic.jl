The BR1 scheme works well for convection-dominated problems, but may cause instabilities or 
reduced convergence for diffusion-dominated problems. 
In the latter case, the [`ViscousFormulationLocalDG`](@ref) scheme is recommended.

not need to be specialized for `Gradient` and `Divergence`.

The parabolic "upwinding" vector is currently implemented for `TreeMesh`; for all other mesh types,
the LDG solver is equivalent to [`ViscousFormulationBassiRebay1`](@ref) with an LDG-type penalization.

    ViscousFormulationLocalDG()

The minimum dissipation local DG (LDG) flux from "An Analysis of the Minimal Dissipation Local 
Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Convection–Diffusion Problems" by Cockburn and Dong (2007). 
This scheme corresponds to an LDG parabolic "upwinding/downwinding" but no LDG penalty parameter. 
Cockburn and Dong proved that this scheme is still stable despite the zero penalty parameter.
