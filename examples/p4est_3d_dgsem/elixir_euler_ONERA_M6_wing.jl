# In the `StepsizeCallback`, though, the less diffusive `max_abs_speeds` is employed which is consistent with `max_abs_speed`.
# Thus, we exchanged in PR#2458 the default wave speed used in the LLF flux to `max_abs_speed`.
# To ensure that every example still runs we specify explicitly `FluxLaxFriedrichs(max_abs_speed_naive)`.
