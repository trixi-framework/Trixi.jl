# Specify the initial condition as a discontinuous initial condition (see docstring of 
# `DiscontinuousFunction` for more information) which comes with a specialized 
# initialization routine suited for Riemann problems.
# In short, if a discontinuity is right at an interface, the boundary nodes (which are at the same location)
# on that interface will be initialized with the left and right state of the discontinuity, i.e., 
#                         { u_1, if element = left element and x_{element}^{(n)} = x_jump

# the outer nodes at `[-1, 1]` are shifted inwards to `[-1 + ε, 1 - ε]` with machine precision `ε`.
