# Benchmarks

This folder contains some benchmark setups based on
[PkgBenchmark.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgBenchmark.jl)
as described in the [documentation of Trixi.jl](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable)
in the "Performance" section.
Additionally, it contains subdirectories dedicated to specific micro benchmarks
used when developing Trixi.jl, e.g. `multiply_dimensionwise`.
