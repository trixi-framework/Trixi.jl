#src Introduction to DG methods
using Test: @test #src

# This tutorial is about how to set up a simple way to approximate the solution of a hyperbolic partial
# differential equation. First, we will implement a basic and naive algorithm. Then, we will use predefined
# features from [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl) to show how you can use Trixi.jl on your own.

# We will implement the scalar linear advection equation in 1D with the advection velocity $1$.
# ```math
# u_t + u_x = 0,\; \text{for} \;t\in \mathbb{R}^+, x\in\Omega=[-1,1]
# ```
# We define the domain $\Omega$ by setting the boundaries.
coordinates_min = -1.0 # minimum coordinate
coordinates_max = 1.0  # maximum coordinate

# We assume periodic boundaries and the following initial condition.
initial_condition_sine_wave(x) = 1.0 + 0.5 * sin(pi * x)

# ## The discontinuous Galerkin collocation spectral element method (DGSEM)
# ### i. Discretization of the physical domain
# To improve precision we want to approximate the solution on small parts of the physical domain.
# So, we split the domain $\Omega=[-1, 1]$ into elements $Q_l$ of length $dx$.

n_elements = 16 # number of elements

dx = (coordinates_max - coordinates_min) / n_elements # length of one element

# To make the calculation more efficient and storing less information, we transform each element
# $Q_l$ with center point $x_l$ to a reference element $E=[-1, 1]$
# ```math
# Q_l=\Big[x_l-\frac{dx}{2}, x_l+\frac{dx}{2}\Big] \underset{x(\xi)}{\overset{\xi(x)}{\rightleftarrows}} [-1, 1].
# ```
# So, for every element the transformation from the reference domain to the physical domain is defined by
# ```math
# x(\xi) = x_l + \frac{dx}{2} \xi,\; \xi\in[-1, 1]
# ```
# Therefore,
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
# u &= u(x(\xi), t) \\
# u_x &= u_\xi \frac{d\xi}{dx} \\[3pt]
# \frac{d\xi}{dx} &= (x_\xi)^{-1} = \frac{2}{dx} =: J^{-1}. \\
# \end{align*}
# ```
# Here, $J$ is the Jacobian determinant of the transformation.

# Using this transformation, we can transform our equation for all elements $Q_l$.
# ```math
# \frac{dx}{2} u_t^{Q_l} + u_\xi^{Q_l} = 0 \text{, for }t\in\mathbb{R}^+,\; \xi\in[-1, 1]
# ```


# ### ii. Polynomial approach
# Now, we want to approximate the solution in each element $Q_l$ by a polynomial of degree $N$. Since we transformed
# the equation, we can use the same polynomial approach for the reference coordinate $\xi\in[-1, 1]$ in every
# physical element $Q_l$. This saves a lot of resources by reducing the amount of calculations needed
# and storing less information.

# For DGSEM we choose [Lagrange basis functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial)
# $\{l_j\}_{j=0}^N$ as our polynomial basis of degree $N$ in $[-1, 1]$.
# The solution in element $Q_l$ can be approximated by
# ```math
# u(x(\xi), t)\big|_{Q_l} \approx u^{Q_l}(\xi, t) = \sum_{j=0}^N u_j^{Q_l}(t) l_j(\xi)
# ```
# with $N+1$ coefficients $\{u_j^{Q_l}\}_{j=0}^N$.
# By construction the Lagrange basis has some useful advantages. This basis is defined by $N+1$ nodes, which
# fulfill a Kronecker property at the exact same nodes. Let $\{\xi_i\}_{i=0}^N$ be these nodes.
# ```math
# l_j(\xi_i) = \delta_{i,j} =
# \begin{cases}
# 1, & \text{if } i=j \\
# 0, & \text{else.}
# \end{cases}
# ```
# Because of this property, the polynomial coefficients are exact the values of $u^{Q_l}$ at the nodes
# ```math
# u^{Q_l}(\xi_i, t) = \sum_{j=0}^N u_j^{Q_l}(t) \underbrace{l_j(\xi_i)}_{=\delta_{ij}} = u_i^{Q_l}(t).
# ```

# Next, we want to select the nodes $\{\xi_i\}_{i=0}^N$, which we use for the construction of the Lagrange
# polynomials. We choose the $N+1$ Gauss-Lobatto nodes, which are used for the
# [Gaussian-Lobatto quadrature](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LobattoQuadrature.html).
# These always contain the boundary points at $-1$ and $+1$ and are well suited as interpolation nodes.
# The corresponding weights will be referred to as $\{w_j\}_{j=0}^N$.
# In Trixi.jl the basis with Lagrange polynomials on Gauss-Lobatto nodes is already defined.
using Trixi
polydeg = 3 #= polynomial degree = N =#
basis = LobattoLegendreBasis(polydeg)
# The Gauss-Lobatto nodes are
nodes = basis.nodes
# with the corresponding weights
weights = basis.weights

# To illustrate how you can integrate using numerical quadrature with this Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes,
# we give an example for $f(x)=x^3$. Since $f$ is of degree $3$, a polynomial interpolation with $N=3$ is exact.
# Therefore, the integral on $[-1, 1]$ can be calculated by
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
# \int_{-1}^1 f(x) dx &= \int_{-1}^1 \Big( \sum_{j=0}^3 f(\xi_j)l_j(x) \Big) dx
# = \sum_{j=0}^3 f(\xi_j) \int_{-1}^1 l_j(x)dx \\
# &=: \sum_{j=0}^3 f(\xi_j) w_j
# = \sum_{j=0}^3 \xi_j^3 w_j
# \end{align*}
# ```
# Let's use our nodes and weights for $N=3$ and plug in
integral = sum(nodes.^3 .* weights)


# Using this polynomial approach leads to the equation
# ```math
# \frac{dx}{2} \dot{u}^{Q_l}(\xi, t) + u^{Q_l}(\xi, t)' = 0
# ```
# with $\dot{u}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u$ and $u'=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u$.
# To approximate the solution, we need to get the polynomial coefficients $\{u_j^{Q_l}\}_{j=0}^N$
# for every element $Q_l$.

# After defining all nodes, we can implement the spatial coordinate $x$ and its initial value $u0$
# for every node.
x = Matrix{Float64}(undef, length(nodes), n_elements)
for element in 1:n_elements
    x_l = coordinates_min + (element - 1) * dx + dx/2
    for i in 1:length(nodes)
        ξ = nodes[i] # nodes in [-1, 1]
        x[i, element] = x_l + dx/2 * ξ
    end
end

u0 = initial_condition_sine_wave.(x)

# To have a look at the initial sinus curve, we plot it.
using Plots
plot(vec(x), vec(u0), label="initial condition", legend=:topleft)

# ### iii. Variational formulation
# After defining the equation and initial condition, we want to implement an algorithm to
# approximate the solution.

# From now on, we only write $u$ instead of $u^{Q_l}$ for simplicity, but consider that all the following
# calculation only concern one element.
# Multiplying the new equation with the smooth Lagrange polynomials $\{l_i\}_{i=0}^N$ (test functions)
# and integrating over the reference element $E=[-1,1]$, we get the variational formulation of our
# transformed partial differential equation for $i=0,...,N$:
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
# \int_{-1}^1 \Big( \frac{dx}{2} \dot{u}(\xi, t) + u'(\xi, t) \Big) l_i(\xi)d\xi
#   &= \underbrace{\frac{dx}{2} \int_{-1}^1 \dot{u}(\xi, t) l_i(\xi)d\xi}_{\text{Term I}} + \underbrace{\int_{-1}^1 u'(\xi, t) l_i(\xi)d\xi}_{\text{Term II}} = 0
# \end{align*}
# ```

# We deal with the two terms separately. We write $\int_{-1, N}^1 \;\cdot\; d\xi$ for the approximation
# of the integral using numerical quadrature with $N+1$ basis points. We use the Gauss-Lobatto nodes
# again. The numerical scalar product $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_N$ is defined by
# $\langle f, g\rangle_N := \int_{-1, N}^1 f(\xi) g(\xi) d\xi$.

# #### Term I:
# In the following calculation we approximate the integral numerically with quadrature on the Gauss-Lobatto
# nodes $\{\xi_i\}_{i=0}^N$ and then use the Kronecker property of the Lagrange polynomials. This approach
# of using the same nodes for the interpolation and quadrature is called collocation.
# ```math
# \begin{align*}
# \frac{dx}{2} \int_{-1}^1 \dot{u}(\xi, t) l_i(\xi)d\xi
# &\approx \frac{dx}{2} \int_{-1, N}^1 \dot{u}(\xi, t) l_i(\xi)d\xi \\
# &= \frac{dx}{2} \sum_{k=0}^N \underbrace{\dot{u}(\xi_k, t)}_{=\dot{u}_k(t)} \underbrace{l_i(\xi_k)}_{=\delta_{k,i}}w_k \\
# &= \frac{dx}{2} \dot{u}_i(t) w_i
# \end{align*}
# ```
# We define the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) mass matrix $M$ and by the Kronecker property follows:
# ```math
# M_{ij} = \langle l_j, l_i\rangle_N = \delta_{ij} w_j,\; i,j=0,...,N.
# ```
using LinearAlgebra
M = diagm(weights)
# Now, we can write the integral with this new matrix.
# ```math
# \frac{dx}{2} \int_{-1, N}^1 \dot{u}(\xi, t) \underline{l}(\xi)d\xi = \frac{dx}{2} M \underline{\dot{u}}(t),
# ```
# where $\underline{\dot{u}} = (\dot{u}_0, ..., \dot{u}_N)^T$ and $\underline{l}$ respectively.

# **Note:** Since the LGL quadrature with $N+1$ nodes is exact up to functions of degree $2N-1$ and
# $\dot{u}(\xi, t) l_i(\xi)$ is of degree $2N$, in general the following holds
# ```math
# \int_{-1}^1 \dot{u}(\xi, t) l_i(\xi) d\xi \neq \int_{-1, N}^1 \dot{u}(\xi, t) l_i(\xi) d\xi.
# ```
# With an exact integration the mass matrix would be dense. Choosing numerical integrating and quadrature
# with the exact same nodes (collocation) leads to the sparse and diagonal mass matrix $M$. This
# is called mass lumping and has the big advantage of an easy invertation of the matrix.

# #### Term II:
# We use spatial partial integration for the second term:
# ```math
# \int_{-1}^1 u'(\xi, t) l_i(\xi) d\xi = [u l_i]_{-1}^1 - \int_{-1}^1 u l_i'd\xi
# ```
# The resulting integral can be solved exactly with LGL quadrature since the polynomial is now
# of degree $2N-1$.

# Again, we split the calculation in two steps.

# #### Surface term
# As mentioned before, we approximate the solution with a polynomial in every element. Therefore, in
# general the value of this approximation at the interfaces between two elements is not unique. To solve
# this problem we introduce the idea of the numerical flux $u^*$, which will give an exact value at
# the interfaces. One of many different approaches and definitions for the calculation of the
# numerical flux we will deal with in [4. Numerical flux](@ref numerical_flux).
# ```math
# [u l_i]_{-1}^1 = u^*\big|^1 l_i(+1) - u^*\big|_{-1} l_i(-1)
# ```
# Since the Gauss-Lobatto nodes contain the element boundaries $-1$ and $+1$, we can use the
# Kronecker property of $l_i$ for the calculation of $l_i(-1)$ and $l_i(+1)$.
# ```math
# [u \underline{l}]_{-1}^1 = u^*\big|^1 \left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)
# - u^*\big|_{-1} \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{array}\right)
# = B \underline{u}^*(t)
# ```
# with the boundary matrix
# ```math
# B = \begin{pmatrix}
# -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
# 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
# \vdots & \vdots & 0 & 0\\
# 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1
# \end{pmatrix}
# \qquad\text{and}\qquad
# \underline{u}^*(t) = \left(\begin{array}{c} u^*\big|_{-1} \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ u^*\big|^1\end{array}\right).
# ```
B = diagm([-1; zeros(polydeg - 1); 1])

# #### Volume term
# As mentioned before, the new integral can be solved exact since the function inside is of degree $2N-1$.
# ```math
# - \int_{-1}^1 u l_i'd\xi = - \int_{-1, N}^1 u l_i' d\xi
# = - \sum_{k=0}^N u(\xi_k, t) l_i'(\xi_k) w_k
# = - \sum_{k=0}^N u_k(t) D_{ki} w_k
# ```
# where $D$ is the derivative matrix defined by $D_{ki} = l_i'(\xi_k)$ for $i,k=0,...,N$.
D = basis.derivative_matrix

# To show why this matrix is called the derivative matrix, we go back to our example $f(x)=x^3$.
# We calculate the derivation of $f$ at the Gauss-Lobatto nodes $\{\xi_k\}_{k=0}^N$ with $N=8$.
# ```math
# f'|_{x=\xi_k} = \Big( \sum_{j=0}^8 f(\xi_j) l_j(x) \Big)'|_{x=\xi_k} = \sum_{j=0}^8 f(\xi_j) l_j'(\xi_k)
# = \sum_{j=0}^8 f(\xi_j) D_{kj}
# ```
# for $k=0,...,N$ and therefore, $\underline{f}' = D \underline{f}$.
basis_N8 = LobattoLegendreBasis(8)
plot(vec(x), x -> 3 * x^2, label="f'", lw=2)
scatter!(basis_N8.nodes, basis_N8.derivative_matrix * basis_N8.nodes.^3, label="Df", lw=3)

# Combining the volume term for every $i=0,...,N$ results in
# ```math
# \int_{-1}^1 u \underline{l'} d\xi = - D^T M \underline{u}(t)
# ```

# Putting all parts together we get the following equation for the element $Q_l$
# ```math
# \frac{dx}{2} M \underline{\dot{u}}(t) = - B \underline{u}^*(t) + D^T M \underline{u}(t)
# ```
# or equivalent
# ```math
# \underline{\dot{u}}^{Q_l}(t) = \frac{2}{dx} \Big[ - M^{-1} B \underline{u}^{{Q_l}^*}(t) + M^{-1} D^T M \underline{u}^{Q_l}(t)\Big].
# ```
# This is called the weak form of the DGSEM.

# **Note:** For every element $Q_l$ we get a system of $N+1$ ordinary differential equations to
# calculate $N+1$ coefficients. Since the numerical flux $u^*$ is depending on extern values at
# the interfaces, the equation systems of adjacent elements are weakly linked.

# ### [iv. Numerical flux](@id numerical_flux)
# As mentioned above, we still have to handle the problem of different values at the same point at
# the interfaces. This happens with the ideas of the numerical flux $f^*(u)=u^*$. The role of $f^*$
# might seem minor in this simple example, but is important for more complicated problems.
# There are two values at the same spatial coordinate. Let's say we are looking at the interface between
# the elements $Q_l$ and $Q_{l+1}$, while both elements got $N+1$ nodes as defined before. We call
# the first value of the right element $u_R=u_0^{Q_{l+1}}$ and the last one of the left element
# $u_L=u_N^{Q_l}$. So, for the value of the numerical flux on that interface the following holds
# ```math
# u^* = u^*(u_L, u_R).
# ```
# These values are interpreted as start values of a so-called Riemann problem. There are many
# different (approximate) Riemann solvers available and useful for different problems. We will
# use the local Lax-Friedrichs flux.
surface_flux = flux_lax_friedrichs

# The only missing ingredient is the flux calculation at the boundaries $-1$ and $+1$.
# ```math
# u^{{Q_{first}}^*}\big|_{-1} = u^{{Q_{first}}^*}\big|_{-1}(u^{bound}(-1), u_R)
# \quad\text{and}\quad
# u^{{Q_{last}}^*}\big|^1 = u^{{Q_{last}}^*}\big|^1(u_L, u^{bound}(1))
# ```
# The boundaries are periodic, which means that the last value of the last element $u^{Q_{last}}_N$
# is used as $u_L$ at the first interface and accordingly for the other boundary.

# Now, we implement a function, that calculates $\underline{\dot{u}}^{Q_l}$ for the given matrices,
# $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{u}^*$.
