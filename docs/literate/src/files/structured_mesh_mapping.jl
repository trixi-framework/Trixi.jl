#src # Structured mesh with curvilinear mapping

# Here, we want to introduce another mesh type of [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl).
# More precisely, this tutorial is about the curved mesh type [`StructuredMesh`](@ref) supporting
# curved meshes.

# # Creating a curved mesh
# There are two basic options to define a curved [`StructuredMesh`](@ref) in Trixi.jl. You can
# implement curves for the domain boundaries, or alternatively, set up directly the complete
# transformation mapping. We now present one short example each.

# ## Mesh defined by domain boundary curves
# Both examples are based on a semdiscretization of the 2D compressible Euler equations.

# The domain boundary curves with curve parameter in $[-1,1]$ are sorted as shown in the sketch.
# They always are orientated from negative to positive coordinate, such that the corners have to
# fit like this $f_1(+1) = f_4(-1)$, $f_3(+1) = f_2(-1)$, etc.

# In our case we can define the domain boundary curves as follows:
r0 = 0.5 # inner radius
r1 = 5.0 # outer radius
f1(xi)  = SVector( r0 + 0.5 * (r1 - r0) * (xi + 1), 0.0) # right line
f2(xi)  = SVector(-r0 - 0.5 * (r1 - r0) * (xi + 1), 0.0) # left line
f3(eta) = SVector(r0 * cos(0.5 * pi * (eta + 1)), r0 * sin(0.5 * pi * (eta + 1))) # inner circle
f4(eta) = SVector(r1 * cos(0.5 * pi * (eta + 1)), r1 * sin(0.5 * pi * (eta + 1))) # outer circle

# We create a curved mesh with 16 x 16 elements. The defined domain boundary curves are passed as a tuple.

# ## Mesh directly defined by the transformation mapping
# As mentioned before, you can also define the domain for a `StructuredMesh` by directly setting up
# a transformation mapping. Here, we want to present a nice mapping, which is often used to test
# free-stream preservation. Exact free-stream preservation is a crucial property of any numerical
# method on curvilinear grids. The mapping is a reduced 2D version of the mapping described in
# [Rueda-Ramírez et al. (2021), p.18](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12040).

# initial condition.

# We define the transformation mapping with variables in $[-1, 1]$ as described in

                  cos(2 * pi * (2 * y - 3)/3))

  return SVector(x, y)
end

# Instead of a tuple of boundary functions, the `mesh` now has the mapping as its parameter.

            save_everystep=false, callback=callbacks);

# Now, we want to verify the free-stream preservation property and plot the mesh. For the verification,
# we calculate the absolute difference of the first conservation variable density `u[1]` and `1.0`.
# To plot this error and the mesh, we are using the visualization feature `ScalarPlotData2D`,
# explained in [visualization](@ref visualization).

end

using Plots
plot(pd, title="Error in density")
plot!(getmesh(pd))

# We observe that the errors in the variable `density` are at the level of machine accuracy.
# Moreover, the plot shows the mesh structure resulting from our transformation mapping.

# Of course, you can also use other mappings as for instance shifts by $(x, y)$
# ```julia
# mapping(xi, eta) = SVector(xi + x, eta + y)
# ```
# or rotations with a rotation matrix $T$
# ```julia
# mapping(xi, eta) = T * SVector(xi, eta).
# ```

# For another curved mesh type, there is a [tutorial](@ref hohqmesh_tutorial) about Trixi.jl's
