#src # Shock capturing with flux differencing and stage limiter

# This tutorial contains a short summary of the idea of shock capturing for DGSEM with flux differencing
# and its implementation in [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl).
# In the second part, an implementation of a positivity preserving limiter is added to the simulation.


# # Shock capturing with flux differencing

# The following rough explanation is on a very basic level. More information about an entropy stable
# shock-capturing strategy for DGSEM discretizations of advection dominated problems, such as the
# compressible Euler equations or the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, can be found in
# [Hennemann et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109935). In
# [Rueda-Ram√≠rez et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110580) you find the extension to
# the systems with non-conservative terms, such as the compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations.

# The strategy for a shock-capturing method presented by Hennemann et al. is based on a hybrid blending
# of a high-order DG method with a low-order variant. The low-order subcell finite volume (FV) method is created
# directly with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes already used for the high-order DGSEM.
# Then, the final method is a convex combination with regulating indicator $\alpha$ of these two methods.

# Since the surface integral is equal for both the DG and the subcell FV method, only the volume integral divides
# between the two methods.

# This strategy for the volume integral is implemented in Trixi.jl under the name of
# [`VolumeIntegralShockCapturingHG`](@ref) with the three parameters of the indicator and the volume fluxes for
# the DG and the subcell FV method.

# Note, that the DG method is based on the flux differencing formulation. Hence, you have to use a
# two-point flux, such as [`flux_ranocha`](@ref), [`flux_shima_etal`](@ref), [`flux_chandrashekar`](@ref) or [`flux_kennedy_gruber`](@ref),
# for the DG volume flux. We would recommend to use the entropy conserving flux `flux_ranocha` by
# [Ranocha (2018)](https://cuvillier.de/en/shop/publications/7743) for the compressible Euler equations.
# ````julia
# volume_integral = VolumeIntegralShockCapturingHG(indicator_sc;
#                                                  volume_flux_dg=volume_flux_dg,
#                                                  volume_flux_fv=volume_flux_fv)
# ````


# We now focus on a choice of the shock capturing indicator `indicator_sc`.
# A possible indicator is $\alpha_{HG}$ presented by Hennemann et al. (p.10), which depends on the
# current approximation with modal coefficients $\{m_j\}_{j=0}^N$ of a given `variable`.

# The indicator is calculated for every DG element by itself. First, we calculate a smooth $\alpha$ by
# ```math
# \alpha = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\frac{-s}{\mathbb{T}}(\mathbb{E}-\mathbb{T}))}
# ```
# with the total energy $\mathbb{E}=\max\big(\frac{m_N^2}{\sum_{j=0}^N m_j^2}, \frac{m_{N-1}^2}{\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} m_j^2}\big)$,
# threshold $\mathbb{T}= 0.5 * 10^{-1.8*(N+1)^{1/4}}$ and parameter $s=ln\big(\frac{1-0.0001}{0.0001}\big)\approx 9.21024$.

# For computational efficiency, $\alpha_{min}$ is introduced und used for
# ```math
# \tilde{\alpha} = \begin{cases}
# 0, & \text{if } \alpha<\alpha_{min}\\
# \alpha, & \text{if } \alpha_{min}\leq \alpha \leq 1- \alpha_{min}\\
# 1, & \text{if } 1-\alpha_{min}<\alpha.
# \end{cases}
# ```

# Moreover, the parameter $\alpha_{max}$ sets a maximal value for $\alpha$ by
# ```math
# \alpha = \min\{\tilde{\alpha}, \alpha_{max}\}.
# ```
# This allows to control the maximal dissipation.

# To remove numerical artifact the final indicator is smoothed with all the neighboring elements'
# indicators. This is activated with `alpha_smooth=true`.
# ```math
# \alpha_{HG} = \max_E \{ \alpha, 0.5 * \alpha_E\},
# ```
# where $E$ are all elements sharing a face with the current element.

# Furthermore, you can specify the variable used for the calculation. For instance you can choose
# `density`, `pressure` or both with `density_pressure` for the compressible Euler equations.
# For every equation there is also the option to use the first conservation variable with `first`.

# This indicator is implemented in Trixi.jl and called [`IndicatorHennemannGassner`](@ref) with the parameters
# `equations`, `basis`, `alpha_max`, `alpha_min`, `alpha_smooth` and `variable`.
# ````julia
# indicator_sc = IndicatorHennemannGassner(equations, basis,
#                                          alpha_max=0.5,
#                                          alpha_min=0.001,
#                                          alpha_smooth=true,
#                                          variable=variable)

# # Positivity preserving limiter

# Some numerical solutions are physically meaningless, for instance negative values of pressure
# or density for the compressible Euler equations. This often results in crashed simulations since
# the calculation of numerical fluxes or stable time steps uses mathematical operations like roots or
# logarithms. One option to avoid these cases are a-posteriori positivity preserving limiters.
# Trixi.jl provides the fully-discrete positivity-preserving limiter of
# [Zhang, Shu (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2011.0153).

# It works the following way. For every passed (scalar) variable and for every DG element we calculate
# the minimal value $value_{min}$. If this value falls below the given threshold $\varepsilon$,
# the approximation is slightly adapted such that the minimal value of the relevant variable lies
# now above the threshold.
# ```math
# \underline{u}^{new} = \theta * \underline{u} + (1-\theta) * u_{mean}
# ```
# where $\underline{u}$ are the collected pointwise evaluation coefficients in element $e$ and
# $u_{mean}$ the integral mean of the quantity in $e$. The new coefficients are a convex combination
# of these two values with factor
# ```math
# \theta = \frac{value_{mean} - \varepsilon}{value_{mean} - value_{min}},
# ```
# where $value_{mean}$ is the relevant variable evaluated for the mean value $u_{mean}$.

# The adapted approximation keeps the exact same mean value, but the relevant variable is now greater
# or equal the threshold $\varepsilon$ at every node in every element.

# We specify the variables the way we did before for the shock capturing variables. For the
# compressible Euler equations `density`, `pressure` or the combined variable `density_pressure`
# are a reasonable choice.

# You can implement the limiter in Trixi.jl using [`PositivityPreservingLimiterZhangShu`](@ref) with parameters
# `threshold` and `variables`.
# ````julia
# stage_limiter! = PositivityPreservingLimiterZhangShu(thresholds=thresholds,
#                                                      variables=variables)
# ````
# Then, the limiter is added to the time integration method in the `solve` function. For instance, like
# ````julia
# CarpenterKennedy2N54(stage_limiter!, williamson_condition=false)
# ````
# or
# ````julia
# SSPRK43(stage_limiter!).
# ````
