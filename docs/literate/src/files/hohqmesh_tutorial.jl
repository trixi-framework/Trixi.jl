#src # Unstructured meshes with HOHQMesh.jl

# Trixi.jl supports numerical approximations on unstructured quadrilateral meshes
# with the [`UnstructuredMesh2D`](@ref) mesh type.

# The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use the `UnstructuredMesh2D`
# functionality of Trixi.jl. This begins by running and visualizing an available unstructured
# quadrilateral mesh example. Then, the tutorial will demonstrate how to
# conceptualize a problem with curved boundaries, generate
# a curvilinear mesh using the available software in the Trixi.jl ecosystem,
# and then run a simulation using Trixi.jl on said mesh.

# Unstructured quadrilateral meshes can be made
# with the [High-Order Hex-Quad Mesh (HOHQMesh) generator](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh)
# created and developed by David Kopriva.
# HOHQMesh is a mesh generator specifically designed for spectral element methods.
# It provides high-order boundary curve information (needed to accurately set boundary conditions)
# and elements can be larger (due to the high accuracy of the spatial approximation)
# compared to traditional finite element mesh generators.
# For more information about the design and features of HOHQMesh one can refer to its
# [official documentation](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh/).

# HOHQMesh is incorporated into the Trixi.jl framework via the registered Julia package
# [HOHQMesh.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/HOHQMesh.jl).
# This package provides a Julia wrapper for the HOHQMesh generator that allows users to easily create mesh
# files without the need to build HOHQMesh from source. To install the HOHQMesh package execute
# ```julia
# import Pkg; Pkg.add("HOHQMesh")
# ```
# Now we are ready to generate an unstructured quadrilateral mesh that can be used by Trixi.jl.

# ## Running and visualizing an unstructured simulation

# Trixi.jl supports solving hyperbolic problems on several mesh types.
# There is a default example for this mesh type that can be executed by

using Trixi
redirect_stdio(stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull) do # code that prints annoying stuff we don't want to see here #hide #md
trixi_include(default_example_unstructured())
end #hide #md

# This will compute a smooth, manufactured solution test case for the 2D compressible Euler equations
# on the curved quadrilateral mesh described in the
# [Trixi.jl documentation](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/meshes/unstructured_quad_mesh/).

# Apart from the usual error and timing output provided by the Trixi.jl run, it is useful to visualize and inspect
# the solution. One option available in the Trixi.jl framework to visualize the solution on
# unstructured quadrilateral meshes is post-processing the
# Trixi.jl output file(s) with the [`Trixi2Vtk`](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl) tool
# and plotting them with [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/).

# To convert the HDF5-formatted `.h5` output file(s) from Trixi.jl into VTK format execute the following

using Trixi2Vtk
redirect_stdio(stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull) do # code that prints annoying stuff we don't want to see here #hide #md
trixi2vtk("out/solution_000180.h5", output_directory="out")
end #hide #md

# Note this step takes about 15-30 seconds as the package `Trixi2Vtk` must be precompiled and executed for the first time
# in your REPL session. The `trixi2vtk` command above will convert the solution file at the final time into a `.vtu` file
# which can be read in and visualized with ParaView. Optional arguments for `trixi2vtk` are: (1) Pointing to the `output_directory`
# where the new files will be saved; it defaults to the current directory. (2) Specifying a higher number of
# visualization nodes. For instance, if we want to use 12 uniformly spaced nodes for visualization we can execute

redirect_stdio(stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull) do # code that prints annoying stuff we don't want to see here #hide #md
trixi2vtk("out/solution_000180.h5", output_directory="out", nvisnodes=12)
end #hide #md

# By default `trixi2vtk` sets `nvisnodes` to be the same as the number of nodes specified in
# the `elixir` file used to run the simulation.

# Finally, if you want to convert all the solution files to VTK execute

redirect_stdio(stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull) do # code that prints annoying stuff we don't want to see here #hide #md
trixi2vtk("out/solution_000*.h5", output_directory="out", nvisnodes=12)
end #hide #md

# then it is possible to open the `.pvd` file with ParaView and create a video of the simulation.

# ## Creating a mesh using HOHQMesh

# The creation of an unstructured quadrilateral mesh using HOHQMesh.jl is driven by a **control file**. In this file the user dictates
# the domain to be meshed, prescribes any desired boundary curvature, the polynomial order of said boundaries, etc.
# In this tutorial we cover several basic features of the possible control inputs. For a complete discussion
# on this topic see the [HOHQMesh control file documentation](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh/the-control-file/).

# To begin, we provide a complete control file in this tutorial. After this we give a breakdown
# of the control file components to explain the chosen parameters.

# Suppose we want to create a mesh of a domain with straight sided
# outer boundaries and a curvilinear "ice cream cone" shaped object at its center.

# The first three blocks of information are wrapped within a `CONTROL_INPUT` environment block as they define the
# core components of the quadrilateral mesh that will be generated.

# The first block of information in `RUN_PARAMETERS` is
# ```
# \begin{RUN_PARAMETERS}
#    mesh file name   = ice_cream_straight_sides.mesh
#    plot file name   = ice_cream_straight_sides.tec
#    stats file name  = none
#    mesh file format = ISM-v2
#    polynomial order = 4
#    plot file format = skeleton
# \end{RUN_PARAMETERS}
# ```

# The mesh and plot file names will be the files created by HOHQMesh once successfully executed. The stats file name is
# available if you wish to also save a collection of mesh statistics. For this example it is deactivated.
# These file names given within `RUN_PARAMETERS` **should match** that of the control file, and although this is not required by
# HOHQMesh, it is a useful style convention.
# The mesh file format `ISM-v2` in the format currently required by Trixi.jl. The `polynomial order` prescribes the order
# of an interpolant constructed on the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes that is used to represent any curved boundaries on a particular element.
# The plot file format of `skeleton` means that visualizing the plot file will only draw the element boundaries (and no internal nodes).
# Alternatively, the format can be set to `sem` to visualize the interior nodes of the approximation as well.

# The second block of information in `BACKGROUND_GRID` is
# ```
# \begin{BACKGROUND_GRID}
#   x0 = [-8.0, -8.0, 0.0]
#   dx = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
#   N  = [16,16,1]
# \end{BACKGROUND_GRID}
# ```

# This lays a grid of Cartesian elements for the domain beginning at the point `x0` as its bottom-left corner.
# The value of `dx`, which could differ in each direction if desired, controls the step size taken in each Cartesian direction.
# The values in `N` set how many Cartesian box elements are set in each coordinate direction.
# The above parameters define a $16\times 16$ element square mesh on $[-8,8]^2$.
# Further, this sets up four outer boundaries of the domain that are given the default names: `Top, Left, Bottom, Right`.

# The third block of information in `SPRING_SMOOTHER` is
# ```
# \begin{SPRING_SMOOTHER}
#    smoothing            = ON
#    smoothing type       = LinearAndCrossBarSpring
#    number of iterations = 25
# \end{SPRING_SMOOTHER}
# ```

# Once HOHQMesh generates the mesh, a spring-mass-dashpot model is created to smooth the mesh and create "nicer" quadrilateral elements.
# The [default parameters of Hooke's law](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh/the-control-input/#the-smoother)
# for the spring-mass-dashpot model have been selected after a fair amount of experimentation across many meshes.
# If you wish to deactivate this feature you can set `smoothing = OFF` (or remove this block from the control file).

# After the `CONTROL_INPUT` environment block comes the `MODEL` environment block. It is here where the user prescribes curved boundary information with either:
# * An `OUTER_BOUNDARY` (covered in the next section of this tutorial).
# * One or more `INNER_BOUNDARIES`.

# There are several options to describe the boundary curve data to HOHQMesh like splines or parametric curves.

# For the example `ice_cream_straight_sides.control` we define three internal boundaries; two straight-sided and
# one as a circular arc.
# Within the HOHQMesh control input each curve must be assigned to a `CHAIN` as shown below in the complete
# `INNER_BOUNDARIES` block.
# ```
# \begin{INNER_BOUNDARIES}
#
#    \begin{CHAIN}
#    name = IceCreamCone
#    \begin{END_POINTS_LINE}
#       name = LeftSlant
#       xStart = [-2.0, 1.0, 0.0]
#       xEnd   = [ 0.0, -3.0, 0.0]
#    \end{END_POINTS_LINE}
#
#    \begin{END_POINTS_LINE}
#       name = RightSlant
#       xStart = [ 0.0, -3.0, 0.0]
#       xEnd   = [ 2.0, 1.0, 0.0]
#    \end{END_POINTS_LINE}
#
#    \begin{CIRCULAR_ARC}
#       name        = IceCream
#       units       = degrees
#       center      = [ 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
#       radius      = 2.0
#       start angle = 0.0
#       end angle   = 180.0
#    \end{CIRCULAR_ARC}
#    \end{CHAIN}
#
# \end{INNER_BOUNDARIES}
# ```

# It is important to note there are two `name` quantities one for the `CHAIN` and one for the `PARAMETRIC_EQUATION_CURVE`.
# The name for the `CHAIN` is used internally by HOHQMesh, so if you have multiple `CHAIN`s they **must be given a unique name**.
# The name for the `PARAMETRIC_EQUATION_CURVE` will be printed to the appropriate boundaries within the `.mesh` file produced by
# HOHQMesh.

# We create the mesh file `ice_cream_straight_sides.mesh` and its associated file for plotting
# `ice_cream_straight_sides.tec` by using HOHQMesh.jl's function `generate_mesh`.

# The mesh file `ice_cream_straight_sides.mesh` and its associated file for plotting

# We note that Trixi.jl uses the boundary name information from the control file
# to assign boundary conditions in an elixir file.
# Therefore, the name should start with a letter and consist only of alphanumeric characters and underscores. Please note that the name will be treated as case sensitive.

# ## Example simulation on `ice_cream_straight_sides.mesh`

# With this newly generated mesh we are ready to run a Trixi.jl simulation on an unstructured quadrilateral mesh.
# For this we must create a new elixir file.

# The elixir file given below creates an initial condition for a
# uniform background flow state with a free stream Mach number of 0.3.
# A focus for this part of the tutorial is to specify the boundary conditions and to construct the new mesh from the
# file that was generated in the previous exercise.

# It is straightforward to set the different boundary
# condition types in an elixir by assigning a particular function to a boundary name inside a
# Julia dictionary, `Dict`, variable. Observe that the names of these boundaries match those provided by HOHQMesh
# either by default, e.g. `Bottom`, or user assigned, e.g. `IceCream`. For this problem setup use
# * Freestream boundary conditions on the four box edges.
# * Free slip wall boundary condition on the interior curved boundaries.

# To construct the unstructured quadrilateral mesh from the HOHQMesh file we point to the appropriate location
# with the variable `mesh_file` and then feed this into the constructor for the [`UnstructuredMesh2D`](@ref) type in Trixi.jl

# ```julia
# # create the unstructured mesh from your mesh file
# using Trixi
# mesh_file = joinpath("out", "ice_cream_straight_sides.mesh")
# mesh = UnstructuredMesh2D(mesh_file);
# ```

# The complete elixir file for this simulation example is given below.

using OrdinaryDiffEq, Trixi

equations = CompressibleEulerEquations2D(1.4) # set gas gamma = 1.4

## freestream flow state with Ma_inf = 0.3

  ## set the freestream flow parameters

  p_freestream = inv(equations.gamma)

  theta = 0.0 # zero angle of attack
  si, co = sincos(theta)
  v1 = u_freestream * co
  v2 = u_freestream * si

  prim = SVector(rho_freestream, v1, v2, p_freestream)

## DGSEM solver.
##    1) polydeg must be >= the polynomial order set in the HOHQMesh control file to guarantee
##       freestream preservation. As a extra task try setting polydeg=3
##    2) VolumeIntegralFluxDifferencing with central volume flux is activated

# Also, we must update the construction of the mesh from our new mesh file `ice_cream_curved_sides.mesh` that
# is located in the `out` folder.

## create the unstructured mesh from your mesh file
mesh_file = joinpath("out", "ice_cream_curved_sides.mesh")
mesh = UnstructuredMesh2D(mesh_file);


# We can then post-process the solution file at the final time on the new mesh with `Trixi2Vtk` and visualize with ParaView.

# ## Setting up a simulation with AMR via `P4estMesh`
# The above explained mesh file format of `ISM-V2` only works with `UnstructuredMesh2D` and so does
# not support AMR. On the other hand, the mesh type [`P4estMesh`](@ref) allows AMR. The mesh
# constructor for the `P4estMesh` imports an unstructured, conforming mesh from an Abaqus mesh file
# (`.inp`).

# As described above, the first block of the HOHQMesh control file contains the parameter
# `mesh file format`. If you set `mesh file format = ABAQUS` instead of `ISM-V2`,
# HOHQMesh.jl's function `generate_mesh` creates an Abaqus mesh file `.inp`.
# ```julia
# using HOHQMesh
# control_file = joinpath("out", "ice_cream_straight_sides.control")
# output = generate_mesh(control_file);
# ```

# Now, you can create a `P4estMesh` from your mesh file. It is described in detail in the
# [P4est-based mesh](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/meshes/p4est_mesh/#P4est-based-mesh)
# part of the Trixi.jl docs.
# ```julia
# using Trixi
# mesh_file = joinpath("out", "ice_cream_straight_sides.inp")
# mesh = P4estMesh{2}(mesh_file)
# ```

# Since `P4estMesh` supports AMR, we just have to extend the setup from the first example by the
# standard AMR procedure. For more information about AMR in Trixi.jl, see the [matching tutorial](@ref adaptive_mesh_refinement).

# ```julia
# amr_indicator = IndicatorLöhner(semi, variable=density)

# amr_controller = ControllerThreeLevel(semi, amr_indicator,
#                                       base_level=0,
#                                       med_level =1, med_threshold=0.05,
#                                       max_level =3, max_threshold=0.1)

# amr_callback = AMRCallback(semi, amr_controller,
#                            interval=5,
#                            adapt_initial_condition=true,
#                            adapt_initial_condition_only_refine=true)

# callbacks = CallbackSet(..., amr_callback)
# ```

# We can then post-process the solution file at the final time on the new mesh with `Trixi2Vtk` and visualize
# with ParaView, see the appropriate [visualization section](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/visualization/#Trixi2Vtk)
# for details.
