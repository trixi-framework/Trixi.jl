# [Julia and its ecosystem provide some tools for differentiable programming](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/scientific-machine-learning-how-julia-employs-differentiable-programming-to-do-it-best).
# Trixi.jl is designed to be flexible, extendable, and composable with Julia's growing ecosystem for
# scientific computing and machine learning. Thus, the ultimate goal is to have fast implementations
# that allow automatic differentiation (AD) without too much hassle for users. If some parts do not
# meet these requirements, please feel free to open an issue or propose a fix in a PR.

# In the following, we will walk through some examples demonstrating how to differentiate through
# Trixi.jl.


# ## Forward mode automatic differentiation

# Trixi.jl integrates well with [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl)
# for forward mode AD.


# ### Computing the Jacobian
# The high-level interface to compute the Jacobian this way is [`jacobian_ad_forward`](@ref).
# First, we load the required packages and compute the Jacobian of a semidiscretization
# of the compressible Euler equations, a system of nonlinear conservation laws.

# basically zero to machine precision.

# Let's check the condition number of the eigenvectors.

# Note that the condition number of the eigenvector matrix increases but is
# still smaller than for the example in 2D.


# ### Computing other derivatives

# It is also possible to compute derivatives of other dependencies using AD in Trixi.jl. For example,
# you can compute the gradient of an entropy-dissipative semidiscretization with respect to the
# ideal gas constant of the compressible Euler equations as described in the following. This example
# is also available as the elixir
# [`examples/special_elixirs/elixir_euler_ad.jl`](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/blob/main/examples/special_elixirs/elixir_euler_ad.jl)

# First, we create a semidiscretization of the compressible Euler equations.

# same time. Thus, we need to make sure that we can treat these `ForwardDiff.Dual`
# numbers everywhere during the computation. Fortunately, generic Julia code usually

# Hence, the `initial_condition` will return `SVector`s of `ForwardDiff.Dual`

# The semidiscretization `semi` uses some internal caches to avoid repeated allocations

# "Error bars" by Randall Munroe, linked from https://xkcd.com/2110

# Similar to AD, Trixi.jl also allows propagating uncertainties using linear error propagation
# theory via [Measurements.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/Measurements.jl).
# As an example, let's create a system representing the linear advection equation
# in 1D with an uncertain velocity. Then, we create a semidiscretization using a
# sine wave as initial condition, solve the ODE, and plot the resulting uncertainties
# in the primitive variables.

plot(sol)

# You should see a plot where small error bars are shown around the extrema
# and larger error bars are shown in the remaining parts.
# This result is in accordance with expectations. Indeed, the uncertain propagation
# speed will affect the extrema less since the local variation of the solution is
# relatively small there. In contrast, the local variation of the solution is large
# around the turning points of the sine wave, so the uncertainties will be relatively
# large there.

# All this is possible due to allowing generic types and having good abstractions
# in Julia that allow packages to work together seamlessly.

# LinearAlgebra, converted to a sparse matrix using `sparse` from SparseArrays,
# or converted to a dense matrix using `Matrix` for detailed eigenvalue analyses.
# For example,
