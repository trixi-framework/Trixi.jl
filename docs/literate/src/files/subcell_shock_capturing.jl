#src # Subcell limiting with the IDP Limiter

# In the previous tutorial, the element-wise limiting with [`IndicatorHennemannGassner`](@ref)
# and [`VolumeIntegralShockCapturingHG`](@ref) was explained. This tutorial contains a short
# introduction to the idea and implementation of subcell shock capturing approaches in Trixi.jl,
# which is also based on the DGSEM scheme in flux differencing formulation.
# Trixi.jl contains the a-posteriori invariant domain-preserving (IDP) limiter which was
# introduced by [Pazner (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2021.113876) and
# [Rueda-Ramírez, Pazner, Gassner (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2022.105627).
# It is a flux-corrected transport-type (FCT) limiter and is implemented using [`SubcellLimiterIDP`](@ref)
# and [`VolumeIntegralSubcellLimiting`](@ref).
# Since it is an a-posteriori limiter you have to apply a correction stage after each Runge-Kutta
# stage. This is done by passing the stage callback [`SubcellLimiterIDPCorrection`](@ref) to the
# time integration method.

# ## Time integration method
# As mentioned before, the IDP limiting is an a-posteriori limiter. Its limiting process
# guarantees the target bounds for an explicit (forward) Euler time step. To still achieve a
# high-order approximation, the implementation uses strong-stability preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta
# methods, which can be written as convex combinations of forward Euler steps.
# As such, they preserve the convexity of convex functions and functionals, such as the TVD
# semi-norm and the maximum principle in 1D, for instance.
#-
# Since IDP/FCT limiting procedure operates on independent forward Euler steps, its
# a-posteriori correction stage is implemented as a stage callback that is triggered after each
# forward Euler step in an SSP Runge-Kutta method. Unfortunately, the `solve(...)` routines in
# [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl), typically employed for time
# integration in Trixi.jl, do not support this type of stage callback.
#-
# Therefore, subcell limiting with the IDP limiter requires the use of a Trixi-intern
# time integration SSPRK method called with
# ````julia
# Trixi.solve(ode, method(stage_callbacks = stage_callbacks); ...)
# ````
#-
# Right now, only the canonical three-stage, third-order SSPRK method (Shu-Osher)
# [`Trixi.SimpleSSPRK33`](@ref) is implemented.

# # [IDP Limiting](@id IDPLimiter)
# The implementation of the invariant domain preserving (IDP) limiting approach ([`SubcellLimiterIDP`](@ref))
# is based on [Pazner (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2021.113876) and
# [Rueda-Ramírez, Pazner, Gassner (2022)](https://doi.org/10.101/j.compfluid.2022.105627).
# It supports several types of limiting which are enabled by passing parameters individually.

# ### [Global bounds](@id global_bounds)
# If enabled, the global bounds enforce physical admissibility conditions, such as non-negativity
# of variables. This can be done for conservative variables, where the limiter is of a one-sided
# Zalesak-type ([Zalesak, 1979](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(79)90051-2)), and general
# non-linear variables, where a Newton-bisection algorithm is used to enforce the bounds.

# The Newton-bisection algorithm is an iterative method and requires some parameters.
# It uses a fixed maximum number of iteration steps (`max_iterations_newton = 10`) and
# relative/absolute tolerances (`newton_tolerances = (1.0e-12, 1.0e-14)`). The given values are
# sufficient in most cases and therefore used as default. Additionally, there is the parameter
# `gamma_constant_newton`, which can be used to scale the antidiffusive flux for the computation
# of the blending coefficients of nonlinear variables. The default value is `2 * ndims(equations)`,
# as it was shown by [Pazner (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2021.113876) [Section 4.2.2.]
# that this value guarantees the fulfillment of bounds for a forward-Euler increment.

# Very small non-negative values can be an issue as well. That's why we use an additional
# correction factor in the calculation of the global bounds,
# ```math
# u^{new} \geq \beta * u^{FV}.
# ```
# By default, $\beta$ (named `positivity_correction_factor`) is set to `0.1` which works properly
# in most of the tested setups.

# #### Conservative variables
# The procedure to enforce global bounds for a conservative variables is as follows:
# If you want to guarantee non-negativity for the density of the compressible Euler equations,
# you pass the specific quantity name of the conservative variable.
using Trixi
equations = CompressibleEulerEquations2D(1.4)

# The quantity name of the density is `rho` which is how we enable its limiting.
positivity_variables_cons = ["rho"]

# The quantity names are passed as a vector to allow several quantities.
# This is used, for instance, if you want to limit the density of two different components using
# the multicomponent compressible Euler equations.
equations = CompressibleEulerMulticomponentEquations2D(gammas = (1.4, 1.648),
                                                       gas_constants = (0.287, 1.578))

# Then, we just pass both quantity names.
positivity_variables_cons = ["rho1", "rho2"]

# Alternatively, it is possible to all limit all density variables with a general command using
positivity_variables_cons = ["rho" * string(i) for i in eachcomponent(equations)]

# #### Non-linear variables
# To allow limitation for all possible non-linear variables, including variables defined
# on-the-fly, you can directly pass the function that computes the quantity for which you want
# to enforce positivity. For instance, if you want to enforce non-negativity for the pressure,
# do as follows.
positivity_variables_nonlinear = [pressure]

# ### Local bounds
# Second, Trixi.jl supports the limiting with local bounds for conservative variables using a
# two-sided Zalesak-type limiter ([Zalesak, 1979](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991(79)90051-2))
# and for general non-linear variables using a one-sided Newton-bisection algorithm.
# They allow to avoid spurious oscillations within the global bounds and to improve the
# shock-capturing capabilities of the method. The corresponding numerical admissibility conditions
# are frequently formulated as local maximum or minimum principles. The local bounds are computed
# using the maximum and minimum values of all local neighboring nodes. Within this calculation we
# use the low-order FV solution values for each node.

# As for the limiting with global bounds you are passing the quantity names of the conservative
# variables you want to limit. So, to limit the density with lower and upper local bounds pass
# the following.
local_twosided_variables_cons = ["rho"]

# To limit non-linear variables locally, pass the variable function combined with the requested
# bound (`min` or `max`) as a tuple. For instance, to impose a lower local bound on the modified
# specific entropy [`Trixi.entropy_guermond_etal`](@ref), use
local_onesided_variables_nonlinear = [(Trixi.entropy_guermond_etal, min)]

# ## Exemplary simulation
# How to set up a simulation using the IDP limiting becomes clearer when looking at an exemplary
# setup. This will be a simplified version of `tree_2d_dgsem/elixir_euler_blast_wave_sc_subcell.jl`.
# Since the setup is mostly very similar to a pure DGSEM setup as in
# `tree_2d_dgsem/elixir_euler_blast_wave.jl`, the equivalent parts are used without any explanation
# here.

# ## Visualization
# As for a standard simulation in Trixi.jl, it is possible to visualize the solution using the

# and [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/). More details about this procedure
# can be found in the [visualization documentation](@ref visualization).
# Unfortunately, the support for subcell limiting data is not yet merged into the main branch
# of Trixi2Vtk but lies in the branch [`bennibolm/node-variables`](https://github.com/bennibolm/Trixi2Vtk.jl/tree/node-variables).
#-
# With that implementation and the standard procedure used for Trixi2Vtk you get the following
# dropdown menu in ParaView.

# The resulting visualization of the density and the limiting parameter then looks like this.

# You can see that the limiting coefficient does not lie in the interval [0,1] because Trixi2Vtk
# interpolates all quantities to regular nodes by default.
# You can disable this functionality with `reinterpolate=false` within the call of `trixi2vtk(...)`
# and get the following visualization.

# ## Bounds checking
# Subcell limiting is based on the fulfillment of target bounds - either global or local.
# Although the implementation works and has been thoroughly tested, there are some cases where
# these bounds are not met.
# For instance, the deviations could be in machine precision, which is not problematic.
# Larger deviations can be cause by too large time-step sizes (which can be easily fixed by
# reducing the CFL number), specific boundary conditions or source terms. Insufficient parameters
# for the Newton-bisection algorithm can also be a reason when limiting non-linear variables.
# There are described [above](@ref global_bounds).
#-
# In many cases, it is reasonable to monitor the bounds deviations.
# Because of that, Trixi.jl supports a bounds checking routine implemented using the stage
# callback [`BoundsCheckCallback`](@ref). It checks all target bounds for fulfillment
# in every RK stage. If added to the tuple of stage callbacks like
# ````julia
# stage_callbacks = (SubcellLimiterIDPCorrection(), BoundsCheckCallback())
# ````
# and passed to the time integration method, a summary is added to the final console output.
# For the given example, this summary shows that all bounds are met at all times.
# ````
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Maximum deviation from bounds:
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# rho:
# - lower bound: 0.0
# - upper bound: 0.0
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ````

# Moreover, it is also possible to monitor the bounds deviations incurred during the simulations.
# To do that use the parameter `save_errors = true`, such that the instant deviations are written
# to `deviations.txt` in `output_directory` every `interval` time steps.
# ````julia
# BoundsCheckCallback(save_errors = true, output_directory = "out", interval = 100)
# ````
# Then, for the given example the deviations file contains all daviations for the current
# timestep and simulation time.
