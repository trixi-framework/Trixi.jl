# Visualization
There are two tools provided with Trixi that allow to visualize Trixi's output
files, both of which are available as Julia packages:
[Trixi2Vtk.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl)
and
[Trixi2Img.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Img.jl).

## Trixi2Vtk
Trixi2Vtk converts Trixi's `.h5` output files to VTK files, which can be read
by [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org), [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov), and other visualization tools. It
automatically interpolates solution data from the original quadrature node
locations to equidistant *visualization nodes* at a higher resolution, to make
up for the loss of accuracy from going from a high-order polynomial
representation to a piecewise constant representation in VTK.

In the Julia REPL, first load the package Trixi2Vtk
```julia
julia> using Trixi2Vtk
```
To process an HDF5 file generated by Trixi.jl, execute
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk(joinpath("out", "solution_000000.h5"), output_directory="out")
```
This will create two unstructured VTK files in the `out/` subdirectory that can
be opened with ParaView or VisIt: `solution_000000.vtu` contains the
discontinuous Galerkin solution data while `solution_000000_celldata.vtu` holds
any cell-based values such as the current AMR indicator or the cell refinement
level.

This allows you to generate VTK files for solution, restart and mesh files. By
default, Trixi2Vtk generates `.vtu` (unstructured VTK) files for both
cell/element data (e.g., cell ids, element ids) and node data (e.g., solution
variables). This format visualizes each cell with the same number of nodes,
independent of its size.  Alternatively, you can provide `format=:vti` as a
keyword argument to `trixi2vtk`, which causes Trixi2Vtk to generate
`.vti` (image data VTK) files for the solution files, while still using `.vtu`
files for cell-/element-based data. In `.vti` files, a uniform resolution is
used throughout the entire domain, resulting in different number of
visualization nodes for each element.  This can be advantageous to create
publication-quality images, but increases the file size.

If you want to convert multiple solution/restart files at once, you can just supply
multiple input files as the positional arguments to `trixi2vtk`, e.g.,
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk("out/solution_000000.h5", "out/solution_000040.h5")
```
You may also use file globbing to select a range of files based on filename patterns, e.g.,
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk("out/solution_*.h5")
```
to convert all solution files in the `out/` directory or
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk("out/restart_00[0-9]000.h5")
```
to convert every one-thousandth restart file (`out/restart_000000.h5`,
`out/restart_001000.h5` etc.).

When multiple solution/restart files are provided, Trixi2Vtk will also generate a
`.pvd` file, which allows ParaView to read all `.vtu`/`.vti` files at once and which
uses the `time` attribute in solution/restart files to inform ParaView about the
solution time. A comprehensive list of all possible arguments for
`trixi2vtk` can be found in the [Trixi2Vtk.jl API](@ref).


## Trixi2Img
Trixi2Img can be used to directly convert Trixi's output files to image files,
without having to use a third-pary visualization tool such as ParaView or VisIt. The
downside of this approach is that it generally takes longer to visualize the
data (especially for large files) and that it does not allow as much
customization of the generated output files.  Currently, PNG and PDF are
supported as output formats.

In the Julia REPL, first load the package Trixi2Img
```julia
julia> using Trixi2Img
```
To process an HDF5 file generated by Trixi.jl, execute
```julia
julia> trixi2img(joinpath("out", "solution_000040.h5"), output_directory="out", grid_lines=true)
```
This will create a file `solution_000040_scalar.png` in the `out/` subdirectory
that can be opened with any image viewer:

!["solution_000040_scalar_resized"](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Img.jl/raw/master/docs/src/assets/solution_000040_scalar_resized.png)

To visualize 3D data generated by Trixi.jl, a 2D slice must be extracted.
A slice can only lie on a plane orthogonal to an axis.
The slice plane is defined by the axis to which it is orthogonal and the axis intercept.

For example, to slice 3D data at the axis `z = 0.5`, execute
```julia
julia> trixi2img(joinpath("out", "solution_000000.h5"), output_directory="out", grid_lines=true, slice_axis=:z, slice_axis_intercept=0.5)
```

Similar to [Trixi2Vtk](@ref), you can also provide multiple files to
`trixi2img` or use file globbing, e.g.,
```julia
julia> trixi2img("out/solution_*.h5")
```
to convert all solution files. The default is to generate a PNG file for each
variable found in the respective file. Use `format=:pdf` as a keyword argument
to create PDF files. A comprehensive list of all possible arguments for
`trixi2img` can be found in the [Trixi2Img.jl API](@ref).
