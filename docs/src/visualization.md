# [Visualization](@id visualization)

There are two possible approaches to visualize results from Trixi: either
directly from the REPL using [Plots.jl](@ref) or with ParaView/VisIt by
postprocessing Trixi's output files with [Trixi2Vtk](@ref).


## [Plots.jl [experimental]](@id Plots.jl)
By far the easiest and most convenient plotting approach is to use the powerful
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) package to directly visualize
Trixi's results from the REPL.
In the following, you will find more information on a number of topics for how
to use Plots.jl together with Trixi:
1. [Getting started](@ref getting-started-plots-jl)
2. [Customizing plot results via a PlotData2D object](@ref)
3. [Plotting a 3D solution as a 2D plot](@ref)
4. [Creating a 1D plot](@ref)
5. [Plotting a 2D or 3D solutions as a 1D plot](@ref)
6. [Visualizing results during a simulation](@ref)

!!! note
    Plotting via Plots.jl is still considered an experimental feature and might
    change in any future releases.

### [Getting started](@id getting-started-plots-jl)

After running a simulation with Trixi in the REPL, load the Plots package with
```julia
julia> using Plots
```
To visualize the solution, execute
```julia
julia> plot(sol)
```
Here we assume that `sol` holds the return value of the `solve(...)` method
(with type `DiffEqBase.ODESolution`), which is the default variable name when
you use one of the example elixirs. This will generate a grid layout with one
subplot for each solution variable, convenient for getting an overview of
the current solution:

![plot-sol](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/130951021-677824f1-ba86-4291-8ff3-6fe2b910a2c9.PNG)

You can save the resulting file as a PNG image file by calling `savefig(...)`
with an output file name that ends in `.png`, e.g.,
```julia
julia> savefig("solution-overview.png")
```

In Trixi, two plot types are available: 2D heatmap plots and 1D line plots.
If you use `plot(sol)`, Trixi will automatically choose the plot type that fits the dimensions
of the `sol` input: 2D/3D data will be visualized as a heatmap, 1D data as a line plot.
For more fine-grained control over what to plot, you can create such an object
yourself, which can either be a [`PlotData2D`](@ref) or a [`PlotData1D`](@ref) object.
For further details on both of these see below:


### Customizing plot results via a PlotData2D object
 For more fine-grained control over what to plot, first create a
[`PlotData2D`](@ref) object by executing
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData2D(sol)
```
This takes the results generated by Trixi and stores them in a data format that
can be understood by the Plots package, and `pd` holds all data relevant for
plotting `sol`. You can pass variable names as strings to `pd` using a
dictionary-like syntax, e.g.,
```julia
julia> plot(pd["rho"])
```
This will create a single 2D heatmap plot of the variable `rho`:

![plot-rho](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/130951033-e3852c55-918c-4e74-98df-ef2353115b00.PNG)

The default plot type and style can be overridden by passing any additional
arguments that are understood by the Plots package. For example, to change the
color scheme and add names to the axes, modify the previous command to
```julia
julia> plot(pd["rho"], seriescolor = :heat, xguide="x", yguide="y")
```
to yield

![plot-rho-modified](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3637659/102724842-d8c20b80-4312-11eb-87db-b3ab22e74568.png)

For more details on the various format options for `plot`, please consult the
[Plots documentation](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/).

In addition, you can plot the mesh lines on top of the solution variables by calling
the `getmesh(...)` function on the `PlotData2D` object
```julia
julia> plot!(getmesh(pd)) # here we use `plot!` with an `!` to add to the previous plot
```
which modifies the previous plot to

![plot-rho-modified-mesh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3637659/102724856-e1b2dd00-4312-11eb-83ae-e470c32f9008.png)

By default, `PlotData2D` will convert the conserved variables to primitive
variables, but this can be changed by passing an appropriate conversion function in
the `solution_variables` keyword argument, similar to the behavior of the
[`SaveSolutionCallback`](@ref):
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData2D(sol; solution_variables=cons2cons) # Plot conservative variables
```
There are several other keyword arguments that influence how the solution data
is processed for visualization with the Plots package. A detailed explanation
can be found in the docstring of the [`PlotData2D`](@ref) constructor.

Another way to change the appearance of a plot is to convert the solution to a
uniformly refined mesh before plotting. This can be helpful, e.g., when
trying different settings for a simulation with adaptive mesh refinement,
where one would like to ignore the mesh changes when comparing solutions. This
is achieved with [`adapt_to_mesh_level`](@ref), which uses the mesh adaptation
routines to adapt the solution to a uniform grid. For example, the AMR solution
from above could be preprocessed with
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData2D(adapt_to_mesh_level(sol, 4)...)
```
When plotted together with the mesh, this will yield the following visualization:

![plot-rho-uniform-mesh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/130951039-f2f91760-539a-4e96-ac39-4053e934040b.PNG)


### Plotting a 3D solution as a 2D plot
It is possible to plot 2D slices from 3D simulation data with the same commands
as above:
```julia
julia> plot(sol) # `sol` is from a 3D simulation
```
By default, plotting `sol` or creating a [`PlotData2D`](@ref) object from
a 3D simulation will create a 2D slice of the solution in the `xy`-plane. You can
customize this behavior by explicitly creating a `PlotData2D` object and passing
appropriate keyword arguments:
* `slice` specifies the plane which is being sliced and can be `:xy`, `:xz`,
  or `:yz` (default: `:xy`)
* `point` specifies a three-dimensional point. The sliced plane is then created
  such that it lies on the point (default: `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`).
All other attributes for [`PlotData2D`](@ref) objects apply here as well.

For example, to plot the velocity field orthogonal to the yz-plane at different
x-axis locations, you can execute
```julia
julia> trixi_include(joinpath(examples_dir(), "tree_3d_dgsem", "elixir_euler_taylor_green_vortex.jl"), tspan=(0.0, 1.0))
[...]

julia> plots = []
Any[]

julia> for x in range(0, stop=pi/2, length=6)
         pd = PlotData2D(sol, slice=:yz, point=(x, 0.0, 0.0))
         push!(plots, plot(pd["v1"], clims=(-1,1), title="x = "*string(round(x, digits=2))))
       end

julia> plot(plots..., layout=(2, 3), size=(750,350))
```
which results in a 2x3 grid of slices of the `yz`-plane:

![plot-v1-0.0-to-0.5pi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/130953841-58df57b2-aa96-4130-9b70-30151856f68f.PNG)


### Creating a 1D plot
When plotting a 1D solution with
```julia
julia> plot(sol) # `sol` is from a 1D simulation
```
Trixi automatically creates a [`PlotData1D`](@ref) object and visualizes it as a
line plot:
![1d-plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3637659/119086020-1e3f4d80-ba05-11eb-873e-1b586a81e7fe.png)

To customize your 1D plot, you can create a `PlotData1D` object manually as follows:
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData1D(sol)
```
In a very similar fashion to [`PlotData2D`](@ref), you can customize your plot:
* `plot(pd)` creates the same plot as in `plot(sol)`.
* `plot(pd["rho", "p"])` only plots specific variables. In this case `rho` and `p`.
* `plot!(getmesh(pd))` adds mesh lines after creating a plot.
* Any attributes from [Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/) can be used, e.g., `plot(pd, yguide=:temperature)`.
* `pd = PlotData1D(adapt_to_mesh_level(sol, 4)...)` adapts the mesh before plotting
  (in this example to a mesh with refinement level 4).

You can also customize the [`PlotData1D`](@ref) object itself by passing attributes
to the [`PlotData1D`](@ref) constructor:
* `solution_variables` specifies the variables to be plotted.
* `nvisnodes` sets the amount of nodes per element which the solution then is interpolated on.


### Plotting a 2D or 3D solutions as a 1D plot
It is possible to extract a straight, axis-parallel line from a 2D or 3D solution and
visualize it as a 1D plot. This is done by creating a [`PlotData1D`](@ref) object with a
2D/3D solution `sol` as input:
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData1D(sol)
```
The plot is then created with:
```julia
julia> plot(pd)
```

By default the `x`-axis is extracted, which can be changed with following attributes:
* `slice` specifies the axis which is being extracted and can be `:x`, `:y` or `:z`
  (`:z` is only for 3D input and default is `:x`)
* `point` specifies a two or three dimensional point. The sliced axis is then
  created in such a way, that it lies on the point.
  (default: `(0.0, 0.0)` or `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`)

All other attributes for [`PlotData1D`](@ref) objects apply here as well.

In the following, is an example for a 2D simulation of the linear scalar advection equation.
First, we have the regular 2D heatmap plot:

![2d-plot-for-slice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/116614302-0f033d80-a93a-11eb-91a1-e44de41e0795.PNG)

From this, we can extract a line plot parallel to the `y`-axis going through the
point `(1.0, 0.0)` with the following commands:
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData1D(sol, slice=:y, point=(1.0, 0.0))
julia> plot(pd)
```
![1d-plot-for-slice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/116614340-1b879600-a93a-11eb-9a80-f46311da16b1.PNG)

This convenient method of slicing is limited to axis-parallel slices, but for 2D/3D solutions it is also
possible to create a plot along any curve you want. To do so, you first need to
create a list of 2D/3D points that define your curve. Then you can
create a [`PlotData1D`](@ref) with the keyword argument `curve` set to your list.

Let's give an example of this with the basic advection equation from above by creating
a plot along the circle marked in green:

![2d-plot-along-cirlce](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/130951042-e1849447-8e55-4798-9361-c8badb9f3a49.png)

We can write a function like this, that outputs a list of points on a circle:
```julia
function circle(radius, center, n_points)
    coordinates = zeros(2, n_points)
    for i in 1:n_points
        coordinates[:,i] = radius*[cospi(2*i/n_points), sinpi(2*i/n_points)] .+ center
    end
    return coordinates
end
```

Then create and plot a [`PlotData1D`](@ref) object along a circle with radius one, center at `(1,1)`, and 100 points:
```julia
pd = PlotData1D(sol, curve=circle(1.0, (1.0, 1.0), 100))
plot(pd)
```
This gives you the following plot:
![1d-plot-along-circle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72009492/118874948-c3660300-b8eb-11eb-8e5e-8ce50e21336e.PNG)

Creating a plot like this has its downsides. For one, it is unclear what to put on the abscissa
of the plot. By default, the arc length of the given curve is used.
Also, with this way of plotting you lose the ability to use a mesh plot from `getmesh`.

### Visualizing results during a simulation
To visualize solutions while a simulation is still running (also known as *in-situ visualization*),
you can use the [`VisualizationCallback`](@ref). It is created as a regular
callback and accepts upon creation a number of keyword arguments that allow,
e.g., to control the visualization interval, to specify the variables
to plot, or to customize the plotting style.

During the simulation, the visualization callback creates and displays
visualizations of the current solution in regular intervals. This can be useful
to, e.g., monitor the validity of a long-running simulation or for illustrative
purposes. An example for how to create a `VisualizationCallback` can be found in
[examples/tree_2d_dgsem/elixir\_advection\_amr\_visualization.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/blob/main/examples/tree_2d_dgsem/elixir_advection_amr_visualization.jl):
```julia
[...]

# Enable in-situ visualization with a new plot generated every 20 time steps
# and additional plotting options passed as keyword arguments
visualization = VisualizationCallback(interval=20; clims=(0,1))

[...]
```

The resulting output of the referenced elixir can be seen in the embedded video

```


## Trixi2Vtk
Trixi2Vtk converts Trixi's `.h5` output files to VTK files, which can be read
by [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org), [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov),
and other visualization tools. It
automatically interpolates solution data from the original quadrature node
locations to equidistant *visualization nodes* at a higher resolution, to make
up for the loss of accuracy from going from a high-order polynomial
representation to a piecewise constant representation in VTK.

In the Julia REPL, first load the package Trixi2Vtk
```julia
julia> using Trixi2Vtk
```
To process an HDF5 file generated by Trixi.jl, execute
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk(joinpath("out", "solution_000000.h5"), output_directory="out")
```
This will create two unstructured VTK files in the `out` subdirectory that can
be opened with ParaView or VisIt: `solution_000000.vtu` contains the
discontinuous Galerkin solution data while `solution_000000_celldata.vtu` holds
any cell-based values such as the current AMR indicator or the cell refinement
level.

!["solution_000000_scalar_mesh"](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl/raw/main/docs/src/assets/solution_000000_scalar_mesh.png)

This allows you to generate VTK files for solution, restart and mesh files. By
default, Trixi2Vtk generates `.vtu` (unstructured VTK) files for both
cell/element data (e.g., cell ids, element ids) and node data (e.g., solution
variables). This format visualizes each cell with the same number of nodes,
independent of its size.  Alternatively, you can provide `format=:vti` as a
keyword argument to `trixi2vtk`, which causes Trixi2Vtk to generate
`.vti` (image data VTK) files for the solution files, while still using `.vtu`
files for cell-/element-based data. In `.vti` files, a uniform resolution is
used throughout the entire domain, resulting in different number of
visualization nodes for each element.  This can be advantageous to create
publication-quality images, but increases the file size.

If you want to convert multiple solution/restart files at once, you can just supply
multiple input files as the positional arguments to `trixi2vtk`, e.g.,
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk("out/solution_000000.h5", "out/solution_000040.h5")
```
You may also use file globbing to select a range of files based on filename patterns, e.g.,
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk("out/solution_*.h5")
```
to convert all solution files in the `out/` directory or
```julia
julia> trixi2vtk("out/restart_00[0-9]000.h5")
```
to convert every one-thousandth restart file (`out/restart_000000.h5`,
`out/restart_001000.h5` etc.).

When multiple solution/restart files are provided, Trixi2Vtk will also generate a
`.pvd` file, which allows ParaView to read all `.vtu`/`.vti` files at once and which
uses the `time` attribute in solution/restart files to inform ParaView about the
solution time. A comprehensive list of all possible arguments for
`trixi2vtk` can be found in the [Trixi2Vtk.jl API](@ref).

Further information regarding the development of Trixi2Vtk can be found in the
[development section](@ref trixi2vtk-dev).


## [Makie.jl [experimental]](@id Makie.jl)

In addition to [Plots.jl](@ref Plots.jl) support, Trixi includes visualization utilities through
[Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/). Trixi provides Makie-based visualization options
both for heatmap-type plots (similar to the [Plots.jl](@ref Plots.jl) recipes) as well as for
interactive surface plots. Support is currently limited to the [`UnstructuredMesh2D`](@ref) type.

!!! note
    Plotting via Makie.jl is still considered an experimental feature and might
    change in any future releases.

A Makie plot can be created as follows: after running a simulation with Trixi in the REPL, load a
Makie backend (for example, [GLMakie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GLMakie.jl/) or
[CairoMakie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/CairoMakie.jl)).
```julia
julia> using GLMakie
```

To visualize the solution and mesh with a heatmap-type plot, simply run
```julia
julia> plot(sol)
```
!!! note
    Both Makie.jl and Plots.jl export `plot`, so if you load both libraries, you will have to
    specify which `plot` function to call via `Plots.plot` or `Makie.plot`.

As with Plots.jl recipes, one can view individual solution components by creating a `PlotData2D`
object and indexing into it with the desired variable name
```julia
julia> pd = PlotData2D(sol)
julia> plot(pd["rho"])
```
Unlike the Plots.jl recipe, mesh plotting is controlled using the keyword argument
`plot_mesh = false`, e.g.,
```julia
julia> plot(sol; plot_mesh=false)
```
The plot command also returns figure and axis handles, which can be used to edit plot titles or
labels:
```julia
julia> fig, axes = plot(sol)
julia> axes[1,1].title = "New title for subplot (1,1)"
```

Trixi also supports interactive surface plots using `iplot`.
After executing
```julia
julia> trixi_include(joinpath("examples", "unstructured_2d_dgsem", "elixir_euler_wall_bc.jl"))
```
we can run
```julia
julia> iplot(sol)
```
This will open up an interactive visualization window:

![makie-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1156048/131613261-dccd1c73-1c06-4770-afe5-d625d3426dfd.png)

The plot can be rotated (click and hold), zoomed in and out (scroll up and down), and panned
(hold right click and drag). Two toggle buttons control whether mesh lines are visible on top
of and below the solution.

Both `plot` and `iplot` use `colormap = :inferno` by default.
[https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/generated/colorschemes/](A different colormap) can be selected
by providing an appropriate keyword argument. For example, `plot(sol, colormap=:blues)` and
`iplot(sol, colormap=:blues)` produce the following figures:

![makie-plot-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1156048/131539853-2ab51c33-5fd3-4d3b-a49b-3b1de8f63a98.png)
