# [Time integration methods](@id time-integration)

## Methods from OrdinaryDiffEq.jl

Trixi.jl is compatible with the [SciML ecosystem for ordinary differential equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/).
In particular, [explicit Runge-Kutta methods](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Runge-Kutta-Methods) from [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
are tested extensively.
Interesting classes of time integration schemes are
- [Explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta methods](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Low-Storage-Methods)
- [Strong stability preserving (SSP) methods](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Strong-Stability-Preserving-Runge-Kutta-Methods-for-Hyperbolic-PDEs-(Conservation-Laws))

Some common options for `solve` from [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
are the following. Further documentation can be found in the
[SciML docs](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/v6.8/basics/common_solver_opts/).
- If you use a fixed time step method like `CarpenterKennedy2N54`, you need to pass
  a time step as `dt=...`. If you use a [`StepsizeCallback`](@ref), the value passed
  as `dt=...` is irrelevant since it will be overwritten by the [`StepsizeCallback`](@ref).
  If you want to use an adaptive time step method such as `SSPRK43` or `RDPK3SpFSAL49`
  and still want to use CFL-based step size control via the [`StepsizeCallback`](@ref),
  you need to pass the keyword argument `adaptive=false` to `solve`.
- You should usually set `save_everystep=false`. Otherwise, OrdinaryDiffEq.jl will
  (try to) save the numerical solution after every time step in RAM (until you run
  out of memory or start to swap).
- You can set the maximal number of time steps via `maxiters=...`.
- SSP methods and many low-storage methods from OrdinaryDiffEq.jl support
  `stage_limiter!`s and `step_limiter!`s, e.g., [`PositivityPreservingLimiterZhangShu`](@ref) and [`EntropyBoundedLimiter`](@ref)
  from Trixi.jl.
- If you start Julia with multiple threads and want to use them also in the time
  integration method from OrdinaryDiffEq.jl, you need to pass the keyword argument
  `thread=OrdinaryDiffEq.True()` to the algorithm, e.g.,
  `RDPK3SpFSAL49(thread=OrdinaryDiffEq.True())` or
  `CarpenterKennedy2N54(thread=OrdinaryDiffEq.True(), williamson_condition=false)`.
  For more information on using thread-based parallelism in Trixi.jl, please refer to
  [Shared-memory parallelization with threads](@ref).
- If you use error-based step size control (see also the section on
  [error-based adaptive step sizes](@ref adaptive_step_sizes)) together with MPI, you need to
  pass `internalnorm=ode_norm` and you should pass `unstable_check=ode_unstable_check` to
  OrdinaryDiffEq's [`solve`](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/latest/basics/common_solver_opts/), which are both
  included in [`ode_default_options`](@ref).

!!! note "Number of `rhs!` calls"
    If you use explicit Runge-Kutta methods from [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl),
    the total number of `rhs!` calls can be (slightly) bigger than the number of steps times the number
    of stages, e.g. to allow for interpolation (dense output), root-finding for continuous callbacks,
    and error-based time step control. In general, you often should not need to worry about this if you
    use Trixi.jl.

## Custom Optimized Schemes

### Stabilized Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods

Optimized explicit schemes aim to maximize the timestep $\Delta t$ for a given simulation setup.
Formally, this boils down to an optimization problem of the form
```math
\underset{P_{p;S} \, \in \, \mathcal{P}_{p;S}}{\max} \Delta t \text{ such that } \big \vert P_{p;S}(\Delta t \lambda_m) \big \vert \leq 1, \quad  m = 1 , \dots , M \tag{1}
```
where $p$ denotes the order of consistency of the scheme, $S$ is the number of stage evaluations and $M$ denotes the number of eigenvalues $\lambda_m$ of the Jacobian matrix $J \coloneqq \frac{\partial \boldsymbol F}{\partial \boldsymbol U}$ of the right-hand side of the [semidiscretized PDE](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/overview/#overview-semidiscretizations):
```math
\dot{\boldsymbol U} = \boldsymbol F(\boldsymbol U) \tag{2} \: .
```
In particular, for $S > p$ the Runge-Kutta method includes some free coefficients which may be used to adapt the domain of absolute stability to the problem at hand.
Since Trixi.jl [supports exact computation of the Jacobian $J$ by means of automatic differentiation](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/tutorials/differentiable_programming/), we have access to the Jacobian of a given simulation setup.
For small (say, up to roughly $10^4$ DoF) systems, the spectrum $\boldsymbol \sigma = \left \{ \lambda_m \right \}_{m=1, \dots, M}$ can be computed directly using [`LinearAlgebra.eigvals(J)`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.eigvals).
For larger systems, we recommend the procedure outlined in section 4.1 of [Doehring et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113223). This approach computes a reduced set of (estimated) eigenvalues $\widetilde{\boldsymbol \sigma}$ around the convex hull of the spectrum by means of the [Arnoldi method](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/Arpack.jl).

The optimization problem (1) can be solved using the algorithms described in [Ketcheson, Ahmadia (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/camcos.2012.7.247) for a moderate number of stages $S$ or [Doehring, Gassner, Torrilhon (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-024-02478-5) for a large number of stages $S$.
In Trixi.jl, the former approach is implemented by means of convex optimization using the [Convex.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl) package.

The resulting stability polynomial $P_{p;S}$ is then used to construct an optimized Runge-Kutta method.
Trixi.jl implements the [Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta (PERK)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.014) method, a low-storage, multirate-ready method with optimized domain of absolute stability.

### Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta (PERK) Schemes

Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta (PERK) or `PairedExplicitRK` schemes are an advanced class of numerical methods designed to efficiently solve ODEs.
In the [original publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.014), second-order schemes were introduced, which have been extended to [third](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111470) and [fourth](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.05470) order in subsequent works.

By construction, PERK schemes are suited for integrating multirate systems, i.e., systems with varying characteristics speeds throughout the domain.
Nevertheless, due to their optimized stability properties and low-storage nature, the PERK schemes are also highly efficient when applied as standalone methods. In Trixi.jl, the _standalone_ PERK integrators are implemented such that all stages of the method are active.

#### Tutorial: Using `PairedExplicitRK2`

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how you can use the second-order PERK time integrator. You need the packages `Convex.jl`, `ECOS.jl`, and `NLsolve.jl`, so be sure they are added to your environment.

First, you need to load the necessary packages:

```@example PERK-example-1
using Convex, ECOS, NLsolve
using OrdinaryDiffEq
using Trixi
```

Then, define the ODE problem and the semidiscretization setup. For this example, we will use a simple advection problem.

```@example PERK-example-1
# Define the mesh
cells_per_dimension = 100
coordinates_min = 0.0
coordinates_max = 1.0
mesh = StructuredMesh(cells_per_dimension,
                      coordinates_min, coordinates_max)

# Define the equation and initial condition
advection_velocity = 1.0
equations = LinearScalarAdvectionEquation1D(advection_velocity)

initial_condition = initial_condition_convergence_test

# Define the solver
solver = DGSEM(polydeg = 3, surface_flux = flux_lax_friedrichs)

# Define the semidiscretization
semi = SemidiscretizationHyperbolic(mesh,
                                    equations, initial_condition,
                                    solver)
```

After that, we will define the necessary [callbacks](@ref callbacks-id) for the simulation. Callbacks are used to perform actions at specific points during the integration process.

```@example PERK-example-1
# Define some standard callbacks
summary_callback  = SummaryCallback()
alive_callback    = AliveCallback()
analysis_callback = AnalysisCallback(semi, interval = 200)
# For this optimized method we can use a relatively large CFL number
stepsize_callback = StepsizeCallback(cfl = 2.5)

# Create a CallbackSet to collect all callbacks
callbacks = CallbackSet(summary_callback,
                        alive_callback,
                        analysis_callback,
                        stepsize_callback)
```

Now, we define the ODE problem by specifying the time span over which the ODE will be solved.
The `tspan` parameter is a tuple `(t_start, t_end)` that defines the start and end times for the simulation.
The `semidiscretize` function is used to create the ODE problem from the simulation setup.

```@example PERK-example-1
# Define the time span
tspan = (0.0, 1.0)

# Create ODE problem with time span from 0.0 to 1.0
ode = semidiscretize(semi, tspan)
```

Next, we will construct the time integrator. In order to do this, you need the following components:

  - Number of stages: The number of stages $S$ in the Runge-Kutta method.
  In this example, we use `6` stages.
  - Time span (`tspan`): A tuple `(t_start, t_end)` that defines the time span over which the ODE will be solved.
  This defines the bounds for the bisection routine for the optimal timestep $\Delta t$ used in calculating the polynomial coefficients at optimization stage.
  This variable is already defined in step 5.
  - Semidiscretization (`semi`): The semidiscretization setup that includes the mesh, equations, initial condition, and solver. In this example, this variable is already defined in step 3.
  In the background, we compute from `semi` the Jacobian $J$ evaluated at the initial condition using [`jacobian_ad_forward`](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/reference-trixi/#Trixi.jacobian_ad_forward-Tuple{Trixi.AbstractSemidiscretization}).
  This is then followed by the computation of the spectrum $\boldsymbol \sigma(J)$ using `LinearAlgebra.eigvals`.
  Equipped with the spectrum, the optimal stability polynomial is computed, from which the corresponding Runge-Kutta method is derived. Other constructors (if the coefficients $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ of the stability polynomial are already available, or if a reduced spectrum $\widetilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ should be used) are discussed below.

```@example PERK-example-1
# Construct second order-explicit Runge-Kutta method with 6 stages for given simulation setup (`semi`)
# `tspan` provides the bounds for the bisection routine that is used to calculate the maximum timestep.
ode_algorithm = Trixi.PairedExplicitRK2(6, tspan, semi)
```

With everything set up, you can now use `Trixi.solve` to solve the ODE problem. The `solve` function takes the ODE problem, the time integrator, and some options such as the time step (`dt`), whether to save every step (`save_everystep`), and the callbacks.

```@example PERK-example-1
# Solve the ODE problem using PERK2
sol = Trixi.solve(ode, ode_algorithm,
                  dt = 1.0, # overwritten by `stepsize_callback`
                  save_everystep = false, callback = callbacks)
```

##### Advanced constructors:
There are two additional constructors for the `PairedExplicitRK2` method besides the one taking in a semidiscretization `semi`:
  - `PairedExplicitRK2(num_stages, base_path_monomial_coeffs::AbstractString)` constructs a `num_stages`-stage method from the given optimal monomial_coeffs $\boldsymbol \alpha$.
  These are expected to be present in the provided directory in the form of a `gamma_<S>.txt` file, where `<S>` is the number of stages `num_stages`.
  This constructor is useful when the optimal coefficients cannot be obtained using the optimization routine by Ketcheson and Ahmadia, possibly due to a large number of stages $S$.
  - `PairedExplicitRK2(num_stages, tspan, eig_vals::Vector{ComplexF64})` constructs a `num_stages`-stage using the optimization approach by Ketcheson and Ahmadia for the (reduced) spectrum `eig_vals`.
  The use-case for this constructor would be a large system, for which the computation of all eigenvalues is infeasible.

#### Automatic computation of a stable CFL Number

In the previous tutorial the CFL number was set manually to $2.5$.
To avoid the manual trial-and-error process behind this, instantiations of `AbstractPairedExplicitRK` methods can automatically compute the stable CFL number for a given simulation setup using the [`Trixi.calculate_cfl`](@ref) function.
When constructing the time integrator from a semidiscretization `semi`,
```@example PERK-example-1
# Construct third-order paired-explicit Runge-Kutta method with 8 stages for given simulation setup.
ode_algorithm = Trixi.PairedExplicitRK3(8, tspan, semi)
```
the maximum timestep `dt` is stored by the `ode_algorithm`.
This can then be used to compute the stable CFL number for the given simulation setup:
```@example PERK-example-1
cfl_number = Trixi.calculate_cfl(ode_algorithm, ode)
```
For nonlinear problems, the spectrum will in general change over the course of the simulation.
Thus, it is often necessary to reduce the optimal `cfl_number` by a safety factor:
```@example PERK-example-1
# For non-linear problems, the CFL number should be reduced by a safety factor
# as the spectrum changes (in general) over the course of a simulation
stepsize_callback = StepsizeCallback(cfl = 0.85 * cfl_number)
```
If the optimal monomial coefficients are precomputed, the user needs to provide the obtained maximum timestep `dt_opt` from the optimization at construction stage.
The corresponding constructor has signature
```julia
PairedExplicitRK3(num_stages, base_path_a_coeffs::AbstractString,
                  dt_opt = nothing; cS2 = 1.0f0)
```
Then, the stable CFL number can be computed as described above.
