# Trixi2Img.jl API

!!! note "Trixi2Img is deprecated"
    Since it is possible to visualize results from Trixi directly from the REPL
    using the Plots package, Trixi2Img has been deprecated. There are still some
    features missing when using Plots, such as postprocessing HDF5 files. Once
    these have been added to the Plots-based solution, Trixi2Img will be
    retired.
