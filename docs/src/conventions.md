# [Conventions](@id conventions)

## Spatial dimensions and directions

We use the following numbering schemes on Cartesian or curved structured meshes.
- The `orientation`s are numbered as
  `1 => x, 2 => y, 3 => z`.
  For example, numerical fluxes such as
  `flux_central(u_ll, u_rr, orientation, equations::AbstractEquations)`
  use the `orientation` in this way.
- The `direction`s are numbered as
  `1 => -x, 2 => +x, 3 => -y, 4 => +y, 5 => -z, 6 => +z`.
  For example, the `boundary_conditions` are ordered in this way
  when a `Tuple` of boundary conditions per direction is passed
  to the constructor of a `SemidiscretizationHyperbolic`.
- For structured and unstructured curved meshes the concept of direction is
  generalized via the variable `normal_direction`. This variable points in the
  normal direction at a given, curved surface. For the computation of boundary fluxes
  the `normal_direction` is normalized to be a `normal_vector` used, for example, in
  `FluxRotated`.


## Cells vs. elements vs. nodes

To uniquely distinguish between different components of the discretization, we use the
following naming conventions:
* The computational domain is discretized by a `mesh`, which is made up of
  individual `cell`s. In general, neither the `mesh` nor the `cell`s should be
  aware of any solver-specific knowledge, i.e., they should not store anything
  that goes beyond the geometrical information and the connectivity.
* The numerical `solver`s do not directly store their information inside the `mesh`,
  but use own data structures. Specifically, for each `cell` on which
  a solver wants to operate, the solver creates an `element` to store
  solver-specific data.
* For discretization schemes such as the discontinuous Galerkin or the finite
  element method, inside each `element` multiple `nodes` may be defined, which
  hold nodal information. The nodes are again a solver-specific component, just
  like the elements.
* We often identify `element`s, `node`s, etc. with their (local or global)
  integer index. Convenience iterators such as `eachelement`, `eachnode`
  use these indices.


## Variable names

- Use descriptive names (using `snake_case` for variables/functions and `CamelCase` for types)
- Use a suffix `_` as in `name_` for local variables that would otherwise hide existing symbols.
- Use a prefix `_` as in `_name` to indicate internal methods/data that are "fragile" in the
  sense that there's no guarantee that they might get changed without notice. These are also not
  documented with a docstring (but maybe with comments using `#`).


## Array types and wrapping

To allow adaptive mesh refinement efficiently when using time integrators from
[OrdinaryDiffEq](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl),
Trixi allows to represent numerical solutions in two different ways. Some discussion
can be found [online](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/pull/1275) and
in form of comments describing `Trixi.wrap_array` and `Trixi.wrap_array_native`
in the source code of Trixi.
The flexibility introduced by this possible wrapping enables additional
[performance optimizations](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/pull/509).
However, it comes at the cost of some additional abstractions (and needs to be
used with caution, as described in the source code of Trixi). Thus, we use the
following conventions to distinguish between arrays visible to the time integrator
and wrapped arrays mainly used internally.

- Arrays visible to the time integrator have a suffix `_ode`, e.g., `du_ode`, `u_ode`.
- Wrapped arrays do not have a suffix, e.g., `du, u`.

Methods either accept arrays visible to the time integrator or wrapped arrays
based on the following rules.
- When some solution is passed together with a semidiscretization `semi`, the
  solution must be a `u_ode` that needs to be  wrapped via `wrap_array(u_ode, semi)`
  (or `wrap_array_native(u_ode, semi)`) for further processing.
- When some solution is passed together with the `mesh, equations, solver, cache, ...`,
  it is already wrapped via `wrap_array` (or `wrap_array_native`).
- Exceptions of this rule are possible, e.g. for AMR, but must be documented in
  the code.
- `wrap_array` should be used as default option. `wrap_array_native` should only
  be used when necessary, e.g., to avoid additional overhead when interfacing
  with external C libraries such as HDF5, MPI, or visualization.
