# Trixi.jl

[**Trixi.jl**](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl)
is a numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation
laws written in [Julia](https://julialang.org). A key objective for the
framework is to be useful to both scientists and students. Therefore, next to
having an extensible design with a fast implementation, Trixi is
focused on being easy to use for new or inexperienced users, including the
installation and postprocessing procedures. Its features include:

* Hierarchical quadtree/octree grid with adaptive mesh refinement
* Experimental support for curvilinear structured and unstructured meshes
  (see also the [overview in the documentation](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/overview/#Semidiscretizations))
* Native support for 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations
* High-order accuracy in space in time
* Nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods
  * Kinetic energy-preserving and entropy-stable split forms
  * Entropy-stable shock capturing
  * Positivity-preserving limiting
* Compatible with the [SciML ecosystem for ordinary differential equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/)
  * [Explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta time integration](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Low-Storage-Methods)
  * [Strong stability preserving methods](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Strong-Stability-Preserving-Runge-Kutta-Methods-for-Hyperbolic-PDEs-(Conservation-Laws))
  * CFL-based and error-based time step control
* Square/cubic domains with periodic and weakly-enforced boundary conditions
* Multiple governing equations:
  * Compressible Euler equations
  * Magnetohydrodynamics equations
  * Hyperbolic diffusion equations for elliptic problems
  * Lattice-Boltzmann equations (D2Q9 and D3Q27 schemes)
  * Scalar advection
* Multi-physics simulations
  * [Self-gravitating gas dynamics](https://github.com/trixi-framework/paper-self-gravitating-gas-dynamics)
* Shared-memory parallelization via multithreading
* Visualization and postprocessing of the results
  * In-situ and a posteriori visualization with [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
  * Postprocessing with ParaView/VisIt via [Trixi2Vtk](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl)


## Installation
If you have not yet installed Julia, please [follow the instructions for your
operating system](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). Trixi works
with Julia v1.6.

### For users
Trixi and its related tools are registered Julia packages. Hence, you
can install Trixi, the visualization tool
[Trixi2Vtk](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl),
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl), and
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
by executing the following commands in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> import Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(["Trixi", "Trixi2Vtk", "OrdinaryDiffEq", "Plots"])
```
You can copy and paste all commands to the REPL *including* the leading
`julia>` prompts - they will automatically be stripped away by Julia.
The package [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
provides time integration schemes used by Trixi, while
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) can be used to directly
visualize Trixi's results from the REPL.

*Note on package versions:* If some of the examples for how to use Trixi do not
work, verify that you are using a recent Trixi release by comparing the
installed Trixi version from
```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.update("Trixi"); Pkg.status("Trixi")
```
to the [latest release](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/releases/latest).
If the installed version does not match the current release, please check the
[Troubleshooting](@ref old-release) section.

The commands above can also be used to update Trixi. A brief list of notable
changes to Trixi is available in [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/NEWS.md).

### [For developers](@id for-developers)
If you plan on editing Trixi itself, you have two options: installing it as a
`dev` package or cloning it to a local folder.

1. **Install Trixi as a `dev` package**: You can install Trixi as a `dev` package by running
   ```julia
   julia> import Pkg

   julia> Pkg.develop("Trixi")
   ```
   This will download and install Trixi to a designated package development directory
   (usually `.julia/dev`, but you can determine the path on your system with
   `Pkg.devdir()`). As opposed to using the `Pkg.add` method as described above,
   packages installed via `Pkg.develop` may have their files edited locally.

2. **Install Trixi in a local folder**: Alternatively, you can download Trixi
   locally and use it from within the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:trixi-framework/Trixi.jl.git
   cd Trixi.jl
   julia --project=@. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()' # Install Trixi's dependencies
   ```
   The last line can also be used to *update* the dependencies if they have changed
   since you first installed Trixi.

   If you installed Trixi this way, you always have to start Julia with the `--project`
   flag set to your local Trixi clone, e.g.,
   ```bash
   julia --project=@.
   ```

Either way, since the postprocessing tool Trixi2Vtk typically does not need to be modified,
it is recommended to install it as a normal package by executing
```julia
julia> import Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Trixi2Vtk")
```
in the Julia REPL. Likewise, you can install
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) and
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
as ordinary packages with the following REPL commands:
```julia
julia> import Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("OrdinaryDiffEq"); Pkg.add("Plots")
```



### Example: Installing Trixi as a package
```@raw html
  <script id="asciicast-373869"
          src="https://asciinema.org/a/373869.js"
          async
          data-cols=100
          data-rows=20
          data-speed=3></script>
```
Please note that the playback speed is set to 3x, thus the entire installation
procedure lasts around 45 seconds in real time (depending on the performance of
your computer and on how many dependencies had already been installed before).


## Usage
In the Julia REPL, first load the package Trixi
```julia
julia> using Trixi
```
Then start a simulation by executing
```julia
julia> trixi_include(default_example())
```
To visualize the results, load the package Plots
```julia
julia> using Plots
```
and generate a heatmap plot of the results with
```julia
julia> plot(sol) # No trailing semicolon, otherwise no plot is shown
```
This will open a new window with a 2D visualization of the final solution:

The method `trixi_include(...)` expects a single string argument with the path to a
Trixi elixir, i.e., a text file containing Julia code necessary to set up and run a
simulation. To quickly see Trixi in action, `default_example()`
returns the path to an example elixir with a short, two-dimensional
problem setup. A list of all example elixirs packaged with Trixi can be
obtained by running `get_examples()`. Alternatively, you can also browse the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/examples/) subdirectory.
If you want to modify one of the elixirs to set up your own simulation,
download it to your machine, edit the configuration, and pass the file path to
`trixi_include(...)`.

### Example: Running a simulation with Trixi
```@raw html
  <script id="asciicast-372987"
          src="https://asciinema.org/a/372987.js"
          async
          data-cols=100
          data-rows=48></script>
```
If this produces weird symbols or question marks in the terminal on your system,
you are probably using Mac OS with problematic fonts. In that case, please check
the [Troubleshooting](@ref font-issues) section.

*Note on performance:* Julia uses just-in-time compilation to transform its
source code to native, optimized machine code at the *time of execution* and
caches the compiled methods for further use. That means that the first execution
of a Julia method is typically slow, with subsequent runs being much faster. For
instance, in the example above the first execution of `trixi_include` takes about
20 seconds, while subsequent runs require less than 60 *milli*seconds.


### Performing a convergence analysis
To automatically determine the experimental order of convergence (EOC) for a
given setup, execute
```julia
julia> convergence_test(default_example(), 4)
```
This will run a convergence test with the elixir `default_example()`,
using four iterations with different initial refinement levels. The initial
iteration will use the elixir unchanged, while for each subsequent
iteration the `initial_refinement_level` parameter is incremented by one.
Finally, the measured ``l^2`` and ``l^\infty`` errors and the determined EOCs
will be displayed like this:
```
[...]
l2
scalar
error     EOC
9.14e-06  -
5.69e-07  4.01
3.55e-08  4.00
2.22e-09  4.00

mean      4.00

2.58e-07  3.99
1.62e-08  4.00

mean      3.99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

An example with multiple variables looks like this:
```julia
julia> convergence_test(joinpath(examples_dir(), "2d", "elixir_euler_source_terms.jl"), 3)
```
```
