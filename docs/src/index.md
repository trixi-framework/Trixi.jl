[**Trixi.jl**](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl)
is a numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation
laws written in [Julia](https://julialang.org). A key objective for the
framework is to be useful to both scientists and students. Therefore, next to
having an extensible design with a fast implementation, Trixi.jl is
focused on being easy to use for new or inexperienced users, including the
installation and postprocessing procedures. Its features include:

* 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations on [line/quad/hex/simplex meshes](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/overview/#Semidiscretizations)
  * Cartesian and curvilinear meshes
  * Conforming and non-conforming meshes
  * Structured and unstructured meshes
  * Hierarchical quadtree/octree grid with adaptive mesh refinement
  * Forests of quadtrees/octrees with [p4est](https://github.com/cburstedde/p4est) via [P4est.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/P4est.jl)
* High-order accuracy in space and time
* Discontinuous Galerkin methods
  * Kinetic energy-preserving and entropy-stable methods based on flux differencing
  * Entropy-stable shock capturing
  * Positivity-preserving limiting
  * [Finite difference summation by parts (SBP) methods](https://github.com/ranocha/SummationByPartsOperators.jl)
* Compatible with the [SciML ecosystem for ordinary differential equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/)
  * [Explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta time integration](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Low-Storage-Methods)
  * [Strong stability preserving methods](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/solvers/ode_solve/#Explicit-Strong-Stability-Preserving-Runge-Kutta-Methods-for-Hyperbolic-PDEs-(Conservation-Laws))
  * CFL-based and error-based time step control
* Native support for differentiable programming
  * Forward mode automatic differentiation via [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl)
* Periodic and weakly-enforced boundary conditions
* Multiple governing equations:
  * Compressible Euler equations
  * Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations
  * Multi-component compressible Euler and MHD equations
  * Linearized Euler and acoustic perturbation equations
  * Hyperbolic diffusion equations for elliptic problems
  * Lattice-Boltzmann equations (D2Q9 and D3Q27 schemes)
  * Shallow water equations
  * Scalar advection
* Multi-physics simulations
  * [Self-gravitating gas dynamics](https://github.com/trixi-framework/paper-self-gravitating-gas-dynamics)
* Shared-memory parallelization via multithreading
* Visualization and postprocessing of the results
  * In-situ and a posteriori visualization with [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
  * Interactive visualization with [Makie.jl](https://makie.juliaplots.org/)
  * Postprocessing with ParaView/VisIt via [Trixi2Vtk](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl)


## Installation
If you have not yet installed Julia, please [follow the instructions for your
operating system](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/). Trixi.jl works
with Julia v1.8 and newer. We recommend using the latest stable release of Julia.

### For users
Trixi.jl and its related tools are registered Julia packages. Hence, you
can install Trixi.jl, the visualization tool
[Trixi2Vtk](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi2Vtk.jl),
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl), and
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
by executing the following commands in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(["Trixi", "Trixi2Vtk", "OrdinaryDiffEq", "Plots"])
```
You can copy and paste all commands to the REPL *including* the leading
`julia>` prompts - they will automatically be stripped away by Julia.
The package [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)
provides time integration schemes used by Trixi.jl, while
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) can be used to directly
visualize Trixi.jl's results from the REPL.

*Note on package versions:* If some of the examples for how to use Trixi.jl do not
work, verify that you are using a recent Trixi.jl release by comparing the
installed Trixi.jl version from
```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.update("Trixi"); Pkg.status("Trixi")
```
to the [latest release](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/releases/latest).
If the installed version does not match the current release, please check the
[Troubleshooting](@ref old-release) section.

The commands above can also be used to update Trixi.jl. A brief list of notable
changes to Trixi.jl is available in [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/NEWS.md).

### [For developers](@id for-developers)
If you plan on editing Trixi.jl itself, you can download Trixi.jl to a local folder
and use the code from the cloned directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:trixi-framework/Trixi.jl.git
cd Trixi.jl
mkdir run
cd run
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=".."))'
```
If you installed Trixi.jl this way, you always have to start Julia with the `--project`
flag set to your `run` directory, e.g.,
```bash
julia --project=.
```
if already inside the `run` directory.

The advantage of using a separate `run` directory is that you can also add other
related packages (see below, e.g., for time integration or visualization) to the
project in the `run` folder and always have a reproducible environment at hand
to share with others.

Since the postprocessing tool Trixi2Vtk.jl typically does not need to be modified,
it is recommended to install it as a normal package.  Likewise, you can install
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) and
[Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
as ordinary packages. To achieve this, use the following REPL commands:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add(["OrdinaryDiffEq", "Trixi2Vtk", "Plots"])
```
Note that the postprocessing tools Trixi2Vtk.jl and Plots.jl are optional and
can be omitted.



### Example: Installing Trixi.jl as a package
```@raw html
  <script id="asciicast-373869"
          src="https://asciinema.org/a/373869.js"
          async
          data-cols=100
          data-rows=20
          data-speed=3></script>
```
Please note that the playback speed is set to 3x, thus the entire installation
procedure lasts around 45 seconds in real time (depending on the performance of
your computer and on how many dependencies had already been installed before).


## Usage
In the Julia REPL, first load the package Trixi.jl
```julia
julia> using Trixi
```
Then start a simulation by executing
```julia
julia> trixi_include(default_example())
```
Please be patient since Julia will compile the code just before running it.
To visualize the results, load the package Plots
```julia
julia> using Plots
```
and generate a heatmap plot of the results with
```julia
julia> plot(sol) # No trailing semicolon, otherwise no plot is shown
```
This will open a new window with a 2D visualization of the final solution:

The method `trixi_include(...)` expects a single string argument with the path to a
Trixi.jl elixir, i.e., a text file containing Julia code necessary to set up and run a
simulation. To quickly see Trixi.jl in action, `default_example()`
returns the path to an example elixir with a short, two-dimensional
problem setup. A list of all example elixirs packaged with Trixi.jl can be
obtained by running `get_examples()`. Alternatively, you can also browse the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl/examples/) subdirectory.
If you want to modify one of the elixirs to set up your own simulation,
download it to your machine, edit the configuration, and pass the file path to
`trixi_include(...)`.

### Example: Running a simulation with Trixi.jl
```@raw html
  <script id="asciicast-372987"
          src="https://asciinema.org/a/372987.js"
          async
          data-cols=100
          data-rows=48></script>
```
If this produces weird symbols or question marks in the terminal on your system,
you are probably using Mac OS with problematic fonts. In that case, please check
the [Troubleshooting](@ref font-issues) section.

*Note on performance:* Julia uses just-in-time compilation to transform its
source code to native, optimized machine code at the *time of execution* and
caches the compiled methods for further use. That means that the first execution
of a Julia method is typically slow, with subsequent runs being much faster. For
instance, in the example above the first execution of `trixi_include` takes about
20 seconds, while subsequent runs require less than 60 *milli*seconds.


### Performing a convergence analysis
To automatically determine the experimental order of convergence (EOC) for a
given setup, execute
```julia
julia> convergence_test(default_example(), 4)
```
This will run a convergence test with the elixir `default_example()`,
using four iterations with different initial refinement levels. The initial
iteration will use the elixir unchanged, while for each subsequent
iteration the `initial_refinement_level` parameter is incremented by one.
Finally, the measured ``l^2`` and ``l^\infty`` errors and the determined EOCs
will be displayed like this:
```
[...]
l2
scalar
error     EOC
9.14e-06  -
5.69e-07  4.01
3.55e-08  4.00
2.22e-09  4.00

2.58e-07  3.99
1.62e-08  4.00

mean      3.99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

An example with multiple variables looks like this:
```julia
julia> convergence_test(joinpath(examples_dir(), "tree_2d_dgsem", "elixir_euler_source_terms.jl"), 3)
```
```

### Showcase of advanced features
The presentation [From Mesh Generation to Adaptive Simulation: A Journey in Julia](https://youtu.be/_N4ozHr-t9E),
originally given as part of JuliaCon 2022, outlines how to use Trixi.jl for an adaptive simulation
of the compressible Euler equations in two spatial dimensions on a complex domain. More details
as well as code to run the simulation presented can be found at the
[reproducibility repository](https://github.com/trixi-framework/talk-2022-juliacon_toolchain)
for the presentation.
